<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE"></a>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> following treatise, which is the work of a Romance philologist of
high European reputation, has not only gone through two editions in
Denmark, but has also been translated into German, Swedish, and Russian.
The popularity which this learned and at the same time charming little
book rapidly acquired abroad, and the favourable criticisms passed on it
by Continental scholars, have encouraged me to present it to my
fellow-countrymen in an English dress. With regard to the numerous
poetical quotations that form so striking a feature of this book, those
which I have translated myself may be distinguished from such as I have
borrowed from standard versions by the appended initials, W. F. H.</p>

<p>Dante, in the fifth canto of his <i>Hell</i>, has celebrated the power a kiss
may have over human beings. In the course of his wanderings in the
nether world, when he has reached the spot where abide those who have
sinned through love, he sees two souls that “flutter so lightly in the
wind.” These are Francesco da Rimini and her brother-in-law Paolo. He
asks Francesco to tell him:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“In the time of your sweet sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what, and how love granted, that ye knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your yet uncertain wishes?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Whereto she replies:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“One day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our delight we read of Lancelot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How him love thrall’d. Alone we were, and no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from our alter’d cheek. But at one point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wished smile, so rapturously kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one so deep in love, then he, who ne’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me shall separate, at once my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All trembling kiss’d. The book and writer both<br /></span>

</div>

<p>I have had a special object in prefacing my studies on the history of
kissing with these famous verses, for I regarded it in the light of a
duty to caution my readers emphatically, and at the very outset, as to
the danger of even reading about kisses; and I consider that, having
done this, I have warned my readers against pursuing the subject, and
“forewarned is forearmed,” or, “<i>homme averti en vaut deux</i>.”</p>

WHAT IS A KISS?</h2>

<p>It may perhaps seem somewhat futile to begin with discussing what a kiss
is: that every child of course knows. We are greeted with kisses
directly we enter the world, and kisses follow us all our life long, as
Hölty sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Giving kisses, snatching kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps the busy world employed.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Nevertheless the question is not altogether superfluous. It seems to me
even to offer certain points of interest, inasmuch as it is by no means
so easy as people may imagine to define what a kiss is. If we turn to
the poets we are often put off with the answer that a kiss is something
that should be merely felt, and that people would do well<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span> to refrain
from speculating as to what it actually is.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What says this glance? What meaning lurks in this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squeezing of hands, embrace, and ling’ring kiss?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only can your heart explain to you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have such matters with the brain to do?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So, for instance, says Aarestrup; but he adds as a sort of explanation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when I see thee my fond kiss denying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway, nathless, mine embrace not spurning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then needs must I to tedious arts be turning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let crabb’d wisdom from my lips go flying.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Know then the voice alone interprets rightful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with poetic fire from heart’s depth welleth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the sweetest of them all by no means!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereas the bosom, arms, and lips, and eye-sheens&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I call it? for the total swelleth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto a language wordless as delightful.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">which has not brought us nearer to a solution of the question. Other
poets give us an allegorical transcription, couched in vague poetical
terms, which rather refer to the feelings of which the kiss may be an
expression than attempt to define its physiology. Thus Paul Verlaine
defines a kiss as “the fiery accompaniment on the keyboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span> of the teeth
of the lovely songs which love sings in a burning heart.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Baiser! rose trémière au jardin des caresses!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vif accompagnement sur le clavier des dents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Des doux refrains qu’Amour chante en les cœurs ardents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avec sa voix d’archange aux langueurs charmeresses!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">This definition, which seems to me to be as original as it is beautiful
and apt, deals, however, exclusively with the kiss of love; but kisses,
as we all know, are capable of expressing many other emotions, and it
enlightens us not one whit as to the external side of the nature of a
kiss. Let us, therefore, leave the poets, and seek refuge with the
philologists.</p>

<p>In the <i>Dictionary of the Danish Philological Society</i> (<i>Videnskabernes
Selskabs Ordbog</i>) a kiss is defined as “a pressure of the mouth against
a body.” As every one at once perceives, this explanation is very
unsatisfactory, for, from the above statements, we could hardly accept
more than one, viz., the mouth. Now, of course, it is quite clear that
one of the first requisites for a kiss is a mouth. “Einen Kuss an sich,
ohne Mund, kann man nicht geben,” say the Germans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>{6}</span> and it is also
remarkable that in Finnish, <i>antaa sunta</i>, “to kiss,” means literally
“to give mouth.”</p>

<p>How does the mouth produce a kiss?</p>

<p>A kiss is produced by a kind of sucking movement of the muscles of the
lips, accompanied by a weaker or louder sound. Thus, from a purely
phonetic point of view, a kiss may be defined as an inspiratory bilabial
sound, which English phoneticians call the lip-click, <i>i.e.</i>, the sound
made by smacking the lip. This movement of the muscles, however, is not
of itself sufficient to produce a kiss, it being, as you know, employed
by coachmen when they want to start their horses; but it becomes a kiss
only when it is used as an expression of a certain feeling, and when the
lips are pressed against, or simply come into contact with, a living
creature or object.</p>

<p>The sound which follows a kiss has been carefully investigated by the
Austrian <i>savant</i>, W. von Kempelen, in his remarkable book entitled <i>The
Mechanism of Human Speech</i> (Wien, 1791). He divides kisses into three
sorts, according to their sound. First he treats of kisses proper, which
he characterises as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>{7}</span> a <i>freundschaftlich hellklatschender Herzenskuss</i>
(an affectionate, clear-ringing kiss coming from the heart); next he
defines the more discreet, or, from an acoustic point of view, weaker
kiss; and, lastly, speaks contemptuously of a third kind of kiss, which
is designated an <i>ekelhafter Schmatz</i> (a loathsome smack).</p>

<p>Many other writers have, although in a less scientific manner, sought to
define and elucidate the sound that arises from a kiss. Johannes
Jørgensen says very delicately in his <i>Stemninger</i> that “the plash of
the waves against the pebbles of the beach is like the sound of long
kisses.”</p>

<p>It is generally, however, an exclusively humorous or satirical aspect
that is most conspicuous. In the <i>Seducer’s Diary</i> (<i>Forførerens
dagbog</i>) of Sören Kierkegaard, Johannes speaks of the engaged couples
who used to assemble in numbers at his uncle’s house: “Without
interruption, the whole evenings through, one hears a sound as if a
person was going round with a fly-flap: that is the lovers’ kisses.” A
still more drastic comparison is found in the German expression, “the
kiss sounded just like when a cow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>{8}</span> drags her hind hoof out of a swamp.”
This metaphor, which is used, you know, by Mark Twain, is as graphic as
it is easy of comprehension; whereas, on the other hand, I am somewhat
perplexed with regard to an old Danish expression that is to be found in
the Ole Lade’s Phrases (<i>Fraser</i>): “He kissed her so that it rang just
as it does when one strikes the horns off felled cows.” Another old
author speaks of kissing that sounds as if one was pulling the horn out
of an owl.</p>

<p>The emotions expressed by this more or less noisy lip-sound are manifold
and varying: burning love and affectionate friendship, exultant joy and
profound grief, etc., etc.; consequently there must be many different
sorts of kisses.</p>

<p>The austere old Rabbis only recognised three kinds of kisses, viz.:
those of greeting, farewell, and respect. The Romans had also three
kinds, but their classification was essentially at variance with the
Rabbis’: they distinguished between <i>oscula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> friendly kisses,
<i>basia</i>, kisses of love, and <i>suavia</i>, passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a>{9}</span> kisses. The
significance of these words is clearly expressed in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Basia coniugibus, sed et oscula dantur amicis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suavia lascivis miscantur grata labellis.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But the Romans’ division is by no means exhaustive; kisses are and have
been actually employed to express many other feelings than those
above-mentioned.</p>

<p>That kisses in this book are arranged in five groups, viz., kisses of
passion, love, peace, respect, and friendship, is chiefly due to
practical considerations; for, to be precise, these artificially-formed
groups are inadequate, and, besides, often overlap one another.</p>

<p>A modern French writer reckons no less than twenty sorts of kisses, but
I find in German dictionaries over thirty different designations:
<i>Abschiedskuss</i>, <i>Brautkuss</i>, <i>Bruderkuss</i>, <i>Dankkuss</i>, <i>Doppelkuss</i>,
<i>Ehrenkuss</i>, <i>Erwiderungskuss</i>, <i>Feuerkuss</i>, <i>Flammenkuss</i>,
<i>Frauenkuss</i>, <i>Freundschaftskuss</i>, <i>Friedenskuss</i>, <i>Gegenkuss</i>,
<i>Geisterkuss</i>, <i>Handkuss</i>, <i>Honigkuss</i>, <i>Inbrunstkuss</i>, <i>Judaskuss</i>,
<i>Lehenskuss</i>, <i>Liebeskuss</i>, <i>Mädchenkuss</i>, <i>Minnekuss</i>, <i>Morgenkuss</i>,
<i>Mutterkuss</i>, <i>Nebenkuss</i>, <i>Pantoffelkuss</i>, <i>Segenskuss</i>,
<i>Söhnungskuss</i>, <i>Undschuldskuss</i>, <i>Vermählungskuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span></i>, <i>Versöhnungskuss</i>,
<i>Wechselkuss</i>, <i>Weihekuss</i>, <i>Zuckerkuss</i>, etc., etc. In German the verb
itself, “to kiss,” is varied in many different ways, <i>e.g.</i>, in Germany
one may <i>auküssen</i>, <i>aufküssen</i>, <i>ausküssen</i>, <i>beküssen</i>, <i>durchküssen</i>,
<i>emporküssen</i>, <i>entküssen</i>, <i>erküssen</i>, <i>fortküssen</i>, <i>herküssen</i>,
<i>nachküssen</i>, <i>verküssen</i>, <i>vorbeiküssen</i>, <i>wegküssen</i>, <i>widerküssen</i>,
<i>zerküssen</i>, <i>zuküssen</i>, and <i>zurückküssen</i>.</p>

<p>We must give the Germans the credit of being thorough, and in the
highest degree methodical and exhaustive in their nomenclature, for can
we conceive a more admirable word than, for instance, <i>nachküssen</i>,
which is explained as “making up for kisses that have been omitted, or
supplementing kisses”? However, on the other hand, it cannot be denied
that they are at the same time awkward and tasteless in their
expressions; a word such as <i>ausküssen</i>, which, for instance, is used in
the refrain: <i>Trink aus! Küss aus!</i> seems to me to smack perilously of
the ale-house.</p>

<p>We have now seen what a kiss is; but before proceeding to investigate
the different kinds of kisses, their significance in the history of
civilisation, and treatment in poetry, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span> still remains for us to reply
to some of the ordinary queries regarding the nature and characteristics
of the kiss.</p>

<p>In the first place we must investigate the kiss in its gustative aspect.
I here confine myself to what Kierkegaard calls “the perfect kiss,”
<i>i.e.</i>, the kiss between man and woman; kisses between men are,
according to that authority, insipid.</p>

<p><i>Küssen, wo smekt dat? see de maid.</i> Yes, its taste naturally depends
entirely on the circumstances, and experience is here a teacher that
sets every theory at nought; but a few leading features may, however, be
indicated.</p>

<p>When Lars Iversen, in Schandorph’s <i>Skovfogedbørnene</i>, has kissed Mette
Splyd, he wipes his mouth and says, when he has got well outside the
door, “That tasted like meat that has been kept too long.” When the old
minnesinger, King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, had kissed his sweetheart he
sang: “Just as a rose that opens its calix when it drinks the sweet dew,
she offered me her sugar-sweet red mouth.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Recht als ein rôse diu sich ûz ir klôsen lât,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swenn si des süezen touwes gert,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>{12}</span></p>

<p>As we perceive from both these examples, there is a great distinction
between kisses in their gustative aspect, but, for obvious reasons, I
shall entirely exclude the variety represented by Mette Splyd.</p>

<p>The most frequently employed and, at the same time undoubtedly the most
fitting epithet of a kiss, is that it is sweet. The shepherd in the
French pastorals is fond of asking for a sweet kiss (<i>un doux baiser</i>),
and poets innumerable, like Wenceslaus, have sung about the beloved’s
sugar mouth. During the Renaissance such expressions as her <i>bouche
sucrine</i> (sugary mouth) and <i>bouche pleine de sucre et d’ambregris</i>
(mouth full of sugar and ambergris) were often employed.</p>

<p>We find this further borne out by two Latin epigrams. One asks:&mdash;“What
is sweeter than mead?” and the answer runs: “The dew of heaven. And what
is sweeter than dew?&mdash;Honey from Hybla? What is sweeter than
honey?&mdash;Nectar. Than nectar?&mdash;A kiss.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Quid mulso præstat? Ros cœli. Rore quid? Hyblæ Mel. Melle hoc?
Nectar. Nectare? Suaviolum.</p></div>

<p>The second epigram goes through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span> similar string of comparisons, and
arrives at the same result: “What is better than sugar?&mdash;Honey-cake.
Than honey-cake?&mdash;The flavour of honey-combs. Than this flavour?&mdash;Dewy
kisses”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Saccharo quid superat? Libum. Quid libo? Favorum Gustus. At hunc
gustum? Basia roscidula.</p></div>

<p>Kisses are sweet as woman’s gentle breath, which, according to a
Roumanian folk-song, smells of “delicate young wine,” or, as the French
poets say, of “thousands of flowers.”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laughing mouth, mouth to caress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing ere its lips you press;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet for kissing, balmy breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the perfume of fresh heath.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A woman’s breath, which intoxicates man, is, as it were, the ethereal
expression of her whole being. In the description of the youthful
Blancheflor we are told that her breath is so delicious and refreshing
that he who experiences it knows not pain, and needs no food for a whole
week.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">De sa bouche ist si douce haleine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vivre en peut-on une semaine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui au lundi le sentiroit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En la semaine mal n’avroit.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, as the flavour of a kiss depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a>{14}</span> on the woman’s mouth, let
us, therefore, investigate how a woman’s mouth ought to be fashioned in
order to fulfil its purpose from a philematological point of view. When
the mediæval French poets describe a beautiful and desirable woman they
say of her mouth that it must be “well-formed and sweet to kiss” (<i>bien
faite et douce pour baiser</i>). The troubadours likewise in their love
poems praise the mouth that is <i>ben faita ad obs de baisar</i>.</p>

<p>If more detailed explanations are wanted they can easily be given. The
lips must, in the first place, be bewitchingly soft; next, they must be
as red as coral:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Los labios de la su boca<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Como un fino coral,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">or else red as roses:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">La bocca piccioletta e colorita,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vermiglia come rosa di giardino,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piagente ed amorosa per baciare.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This last simile is one of the most frequently employed. The beloved
one’s mouth is likened to a rose; it has the scent and colour of a
rose:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a>{15}</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hæc dulcis in amore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Est et plena decore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rosa rubet rubore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et lilium convallium<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tota vincit odore,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">sang the wandering clerks in the Middle Ages, the jolly Goliards, and
they extolled the youth who was lucky enough to kiss the mouth of such a
woman:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Felix est qui osculis mellifluis<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Ipsius potitur.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And, they went on to say, “on every maiden’s lips the kiss sits like a
rose which only longs to be plucked”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sedit in ore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rosa cum pudore.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The old German minnesingers use the expression <i>Küssblümlein</i>
(kiss-floweret), and a bard of the Netherlands sings: “My beloved is my
summer, my beloved is my joy, all the roses bloom every time she gives
me a kiss”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mijn liefken is mijn somer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Min liefken is mijn lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En al de rosen bloejen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dicmael si mi cust.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But all this is only poetry, merely feeble imageries which only give an
entirely weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>{16}</span> idea of the reality. How accurate is Thomas Moore when,
in one of his poems, he declares that roses are not so warm as his
beloved’s mouth, nor can the dew approach it in sweetness.</p>

<p>Now if we turn to the other aspect of the case and see what women expect
from a man’s kiss, then the question becomes somewhat more difficult to
treat, inasmuch as so exceedingly few women have treated of kisses in
poetry&mdash;a fact which is also in itself quite natural. Runeberg, who
himself has so often sung the praises of kissing without, however, being
versed in their nature:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For my part I’ve ne’er understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of kisses what can be the good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I should die if kept away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy red lips one single day.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">asks his beloved:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, dearest maiden, answer me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What joy can kisses bring to thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But she fails to answer him:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I ask thee now, as I asked this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all thy answer’s kiss on kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Besides, it seems very evident from the last line that the situation did
not admit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>{17}</span> calmer and more sober observation which forms the
necessary condition for a reliable answer to the question. I am,
therefore, obliged to attempt to reply to the question myself; but I
readily admit my deficiency in the essential qualification of being able
to do so in a satisfactory manner. Moreover, the literary material at my
disposal is exceedingly inadequate, and, for that reason, I cannot claim
any universal application for my treatment of the subject.</p>

<p>In the first place it seems indisputable that a woman gives a decided
preference to a man with a beard; at all events a heiduke sings in a
Roumanian ballad: “I am still too young to marry; my beard has not yet
sprouted. What married woman then will care about kissing me?”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Că simt voinic neinsorat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nici mustete nu m’a dat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cum simt bun de sărutat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La neveste cu bărbat?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>To judge from the part the heidukes play in the ballad literature of the
Roumanians and Serbs, they must be very experienced in everything that
has to do with women and love, and their testimony must therefore be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a>{18}</span>
accepted as being sufficiently reliable. Besides, we find the same taste
among women in Northern Europe. In Germany there is said to be nothing
in a kiss without a beard: <i>Ein Kuss ohne Bart ist eine Vesper ohne
Magnificat</i> (a kiss without a beard is like Vespers without the
Magnificat); or, still more strongly, <i>Ein Kuss ohne Bart ist ein Ei
ohne Salz</i> (a kiss without a beard is like an egg without salt). The
young girls in Holland also incline to this point of view: <i>Een kussje
zonder baard, een eitje zonder zout</i> (an egg without salt), and they
have in the Frisian Islands some who share their taste: <i>An Kleeb sanner
Biard as äs en Brei sanner Salt</i> (porridge without salt). Lastly, the
Jutland lassies also take the same view of the matter&mdash;in fact they are,
if I may say so, even more refined in their requirements; a kiss is not
only to sound, but it must have some flavour about it&mdash;it ought to be
strong and luscious: <i>At kysse en karl uden skrå og skaeg er som at
kysse en leret vaeg</i> (kissing a fellow without a quid of tobacco and a
beard is like kissing a clay wall), say those who express themselves in
the most refined manner; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>{19}</span> are others who are not so particular
in the choice of words, and these latter say straight out: <i>Å kys jen,
dæ hveken røger eller skråer, de æ som mæ ku kys æ spæ kal i r.</i>,
(kissing one who neither smokes nor chews tobacco is like kissing a
new-born calf on the rump). On the other hand, a person should not be
too wet about the mouth&mdash;that they do not like; <i>e.g.</i>, the scornful
saying: “He is nice to kiss when one is thirsty,” or, as the German
girls say: <i>Einen Kuss mit Sauce bekommen</i> (to get a kiss with sauce).</p>

<p>It apparently follows from this that women are not so simple in their
tastes as men; a kiss by itself is not sufficient, it requires some
condiment or other in addition&mdash;and, for the credit of women’s taste,
let it be said&mdash;this need not always be tobacco. In a French folk-song
the lover tells us that he has smeared his mouth with fresh butter so
that it may taste better:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">J’avais toujou dans ma pochette<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Du bon bieur’ frais,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O qué je me gressais la goule,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quand j’ l’embrassais.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I have already mentioned in my preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a>{20}</span> how dangerous the mere reading
about kisses may be; but, apart from literature, a kiss is something
which has to be dealt with most cautiously. Now hear what Socrates said
to Xenophon one day: “Kritobulus is the most foolhardy and rash fellow
in the world; he is rasher than if he meant to dance on naked
sword-points or fling himself into the fire; he has had the audacity to
kiss a pretty face.”&mdash;“But,” asked Xenophon, “is that such a deed of
daring? I am certainly no desperado, but still I think I would venture
to expose myself to the same risk.”&mdash;“Luckless wight,” replied Socrates,
“you are not thinking what would betide you. If you kissed a pretty
face, would you not that very instant lose your freedom and become a
slave? Would you not have to spend much money on harmful amusements, and
would you not do much which you would despise, if your understanding
were not clouded? Hercules forbid what dreadful effects a poor kiss can
have! And dost thou marvel at it, Xenophon? You know, I take it, those
tiny spiders which are not half the size of an obol, and yet they can,
through merely touching a person’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a>{21}</span> mouth, cause him the keenest pains;
nay, even deprive him of his understanding. But, by Jupiter, anyhow this
is quite another matter; for spiders poison the wound directly they
inflict a sting. O, thou simple fellow, dost thou not know that lustful
kisses are poisoned, even if thou failest to perceive the poison? Dost
thou not know that she to whom the name of beautiful is given is a wild
beast far more dangerous than scorpions; for the latter only poison us
by their touch, whereas beauty destroys us without actual contact with
us, and even ejects from a long distance a venom so dangerous that
people are deprived thereby of their wits. This is the reason why I
advise you, O Xenophon, to run away as fast as you can the very instant
you see a beautiful woman, and with regard to yourself, O Kritobulus, I
deem you will act most prudently in spending a whole year abroad; for
that is the least time necessary for curing thy wound.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought that Socrates’ fear of kissing is a trifle
exaggerated, his idea possibly arising from a certain prejudice derived
from Mistress Xantippe; anyhow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>{22}</span> nowadays, we regard the matter from a
far more sober point of view. We ought, nevertheless, to be well on our
guard against the frivolous opinion expressed in so many modern sayings,
that a kiss is a thing of no consequence whatever. The Italians bluntly
assert “that a mouth is none the worse for having been kissed” (<i>bocca
baciata non perde ventura</i>), and a French writer of the present day even
goes so far as to compare a kiss with those usually-harmless bullets
which are exchanged in modern duels. <i>Bah! deux baisers, qu’est que
cela? On les échange comme des balles sans résultat, et l’honneur reste
satisfait</i> (Bah! two kisses. What of that? They are exchanged like
bullets that miss the mark, and honour is satisfied).</p>

<p>This frivolous notion must not, however, be deemed peculiar to the Latin
nations: it is to be met with even in the North. In Norway there is a
song:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jens Johannesen, the Goth so brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid on her chops a good buss gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kissed her once, and once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each time was she likewise fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each time was she likewise fain.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As you see, the last line of the verse is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a>{23}</span> repeated as if for the
purpose of duly impressing the moral of the song.</p>

<p>It is said in Als: <i>Et kys er et stow, den der it vil ha et, ka vask et
ow</i> (a kiss is like a grain of dust, which any one who would be rid of
it can wash away). We read as far back as Peder Syv<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>: <i>Et kys kan
afviskes</i> (a kiss can be washed away), but he adds solemnly, and for our
warning: “She who permits a kiss also permits more; and he who has
access to kisses has also access to more.” Even the Germans say: <i>Kuss
kann man zwar abwischen, aber das Feuer im Herzen nich löschen</i> (a kiss
may indeed be washed away, but the fire in the heart cannot be
quenched).</p>

<p>Thus hardly the shadow of a doubt ought to exist as to kisses being
extraordinarily dangerous&mdash;or, in any case, capable of becoming so&mdash;far
more dangerous, for instance, than dynamite or gun-cotton; in the first
place, at any rate, inasmuch as people are not in the habit of walking
about with such explosives in their pockets, whereas every one has
kisses always at hand, or, more correctly speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a>{24}</span> in their mouths;
secondly, we are rid of dynamite when once it has exploded, but, on the
other hand, we can never actually be quit of a kiss&mdash;without at the same
time returning it; for we take back the kisses we give, you know, and we
give, too, those we take back&mdash;and, adds the proverb, “nobody is the
loser.” <i>Einen Kuss den man raubt giebt man wieder</i> (One returns a
stolen kiss), say the Germans; and the Spaniards have expressed the same
thought in a neat little <i>copla</i>: “Dost thy mother chide thee for having
given me a kiss? Then take back, dear girl, thy kiss, and bid her hold
her tongue.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">¿Porque un beso me has dado<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Riñe tu madre?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Toma, niña, tu beso;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dile que calle.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Marot has treated the same subject in his epigram <i>Le Baiser Volé</i>, or
the Stolen Kiss.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">About my daring now you grieve,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now I want you to believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m loth your soul again to grieve<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet ’tis not lost; I’ll give it back,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is a French anecdote of the present day about a student who took
the liberty of kissing a young girl. She got very angry, however, and
called him an insolent puppy, whereupon he retorted with irrefutable
logic: <i>Pour Dieu! Mademoiselle ne vous fâchez pas, si ce baiser vous
gêne, rendez-le-moi</i> (For goodness’ sake, don’t be cross, young lady. If
that kiss annoys you, give it back to me). It seems to have had a more
amicable settlement in the case of a Danish couple who had resolved to
break off their engagement: “It is best, I suppose, that we return each
other’s letters?” said he. “I think so too,” replied she, “but shall we
not at the same time give each other all our kisses back?” They did so,
and thus agreed to renew their engagement.</p>

<p>This little story shows us that a kiss is something which cannot be so
easily lost, and I hope, not least for the sake of my book, that we
shall concur in the Italian proverb which says: <i>Bacio dato non e mai
perduto</i> (a kiss once given is never lost).</p>

LOVE KISSES</h2>

<p class="nind">“<span class="smcap">At</span> the time of the world’s creation kisses were created and cruel
love.” Thus begins a Cypriot folk-song, and it is assuredly without the
shadow of a doubt that among all nations which on the whole know
kissing, it gets its sublimest meaning as the expression of love.</p>

<p>In the transport of love the lovers’ lips seek each other. When Byron’s
Don Juan wanders one evening along the shore with his Haidee, they
glance at the moonlit sea which lies outspread before them, and they
listen to the lapping of the waves and the whispering murmur of the
breeze, but suddenly they</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Saw each other’s dark eyes darting light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into each other&mdash;and, beholding this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a>{30}</span><br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">. . . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span class="i0">They had not spoken, but they felt allured,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if their souls and lips each other beckoned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, being joined, like swarming bees they clung&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The kiss of love is the exultant message of the longing of love, love
eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the
lovers’ lips, and “rises,” as Charles Fuster has said, “up to the blue
sky from the green plains,” like a tender, trembling thank-offering.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Que tous les cœurs soient apaisés<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et toutes les lèvres ouvertes,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Monte au ciel bleu des plaines vertes!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The love kiss, rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of
infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all
other earthly joys in sublimity&mdash;at any rate all poets say so&mdash;and no
one has expressed it in more exquisite and choicer words than Alfred de
Musset in his celebrated sonnet on Tizianello:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beatrix Donato was the soft sweet name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of her whose earthly form was shaped so fair;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Her spotless body held a mind most rare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a>{31}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The son of Titian, for her deathless fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Painted this portrait, witness of love’s care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that day renounced his art’s high claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Loth that another dame his skill should share.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stranger, if in your heart love doth abide,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Say if perchance your lady’s fair as this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mark how poor a thing is fame on earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grand as this portrait is, it is not worth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Believe me on my oath&mdash;the model’s kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus even the highest work of art, yea, the loftiest reputation, is
nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves.
This is what life has taught Musset, and a half melancholy sigh rings
through his exultation over the omnipotence of love. In turning to the
more <i>naïve</i> speech of popular poetry, we find in a German
<i>Schnaderhüpfel</i> (Improvisation) a corresponding homage to the kiss as
the noblest thing in the world:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My sweetheart’s poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But fair to behold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What use were wealth?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cannot kiss gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">And we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle
against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a>{32}</span> the
best resolutions, the most solemn oaths, are of no avail. A pretty
little Servian folk-song treats of a young girl who swore too hastily.</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div>

<p>It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes
to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss
exchanged by lovers.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The evening star was sitting beside a silver cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid from out a twilight grove addressed this star aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Come, tell me, star of evening, what angels think in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by a youth and maiden the first sweet kiss is given?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven’s bashful daughter was heard to deign reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“On earth the choir of angels bright look down from out the sky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a>{33}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see their own felicity then mirrored on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But death sheds tears, and turns his eyes away from such blest mirth.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Only death weeps over the brief duration of human happiness, weeps
because the bliss of the kiss endures not for ever. And likewise, even
after death, lovers kiss. Jannakos and Helena, his plighted bride, die
before their wedding day. They die in a kiss and are buried together;
but over their grave grew a cypress and an orange tree, and the latter
stretched forth its branches on high and kissed the cypress.</p>

<p>The happiest man is the man who has the kiss. In the Greek romance of
<i>Babylonika</i>, which was attributed to Jamblicus, who lived in the second
century of the Christian era, three lovers contend for the favour of a
young maid. To one she has given the cup out of which she was wont to
drink; the second she has garlanded with flowers that she herself has
worn; to the third she has given a kiss. Borokos is called on as judge
to decide as to which has enjoyed the highest favour, and he
unhesitatingly decides the dispute in favour of the last.</p>

<p>The same subject is often the theme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a>{34}</span> folk-poetry, and the verdict
never alters; the joy bestowed by a kiss surpasses all other joys. A
Hungarian ballad runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the hart holds dear the fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bee the honied flow’rets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the noble grape I cherish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After this songs melting, tender,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kisses, too, of lips of crimson,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thine own, O Cenzi mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the wine’s might fires my senses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And songs wake within me blitheness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with love intoxicated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy love, mine own beloved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart no more is longing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After purple, after gew-gaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After what the others long for.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy am I in the clinking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the goblet filled with rich wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happier still amidst sweet singing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my happiness were greatest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared I press my kisses on a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mouth, and that mouth only thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The same idea is still more delicately expressed in the following
Servian ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Proudly cried a golden orange<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the breezy shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Certainly nowhere happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is found to equal mine.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a>{35}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Answered a green apple<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From its apple tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Fool to boast, golden orange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the breezy shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For happiness such as I’ve found,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its like cannot be seen.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then said the breezy meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As yet untouched by scythe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Too conceited, little apple,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That speech of thine, meseems,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For happiness such as I’ve found,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its like cannot be seen.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then spake a lovely maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unsullied by a kiss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thou pratest folly, grass-plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Instead of sooth, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For happiness such as I’ve found<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its like cannot be seen.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But a handsome lad made answer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To every speech they made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You’re mad, all mad, to utter<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such words as I’ve just heard,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a>{36}</span></p>

<p>In another Servian lay, the lover sings that he would rather kiss his
sweetheart than be the Sultan’s guest. In Spain the lover wishes he were
the water-cooler so that he might kiss his darling’s lips when she is
drinking:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arcarrasa de tu casa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiquiya, quisiera ser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Para besarte los labios<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quando fueras á beber.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Greeks say that the kiss is “the key to Paradise”; yea, it is
Paradise itself, declares Wergeland:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, bride, thine embrace more than heav’n I prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, kiss me once more that to heav’n I rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The kiss is a preservation against every ill. “No ill-luck can betide me
when she bestows on me a kiss,” sings the old trouvère, Colin Muset:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Se de li ai un douz baisier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne me porroit nus mals venir.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It gives health and strength, adds Heine:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet could I kiss thee, O my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then straightway I should be made whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a>{37}</span></p>

<p>It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth&mdash;if
one can believe the words of the Duke of Anhalt the minnesinger:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your mouth is crimson; over its sweet portal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A kindly Genius seems for ever flowing.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If on that mouth a kiss I were bestowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I should in sooth become immortal.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Persians, too, had the same idea. The jovial Hafiz laments that
“sour wisdom added to old age and virtue” has laid waste his strength,
but a remedy is to be found for these:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come and drink,” the maiden whispered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Sin and sweetness, youthful folly,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lovingly from lips of crimson,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From my bosom’s lily chalice,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And live on with strength redoubled.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And if a kiss is no good, then nought avails. In another passage the
same bard says, that were he suddenly on some occasion to feel himself
tormented by agony and unrest, no one is to give him bitter
medicine&mdash;for such he detests&mdash;but:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hand me the foaming juice of the vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jest and sing from your heart to mine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38"></a>{38}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And if these prove not a remedy sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a pair of red lips you must straight procure.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if these latter avail not to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I be laid deep down in the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man
stakes his all for a kiss. In <i>Enthousiasme</i> Aarestrup says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ha, you’re blushing! What red roses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deck your lips! A man were fain to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a chasm yawned before him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway peril life to gain you.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And man craves for it as his noblest reward:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">From beyond the high green mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lamentations fraught with sadness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Issue, soft as from a girl’s voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then a youth the sound pursueth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he sees a maiden shackled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fast in fetters thick of roses.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then the fair maid called unto him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Doughty youth, come here and help me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’ll be to you as a sister.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But the youth straightway made answer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“In my home I have a sister.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Doughty youth, come here and help me,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then the lad again made answer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“In my home I have that title.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come, young hero, and assist me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I’ll be thy heart’s belovèd.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Quickly kissed he then the maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ere he loosed her from her fetters,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then went homeward with his bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus runs a Servian ballad, and innumerable analogues to it are to be
found in the folk-lore of other countries, in ballads as well as tales.
It is, you know, for a kiss from the princess’s lovely mouth that the
swine-herd sells his wonderful pan.</p>

<p>But women are aware, too, of the witchery that dwells on their lips, and
the power that lies in their kiss. According to a remarkable <i>saga</i>
which forms the subject of one of Heine’s poems, King Harald Hårfager
sits at the bottom of the sea in captivity to a mermaid. The king’s head
is reposing on her bosom; but, suddenly, a violent tremor thrills him,
he hears the Viking shouts which reach him from above, he starts from
his dream of love and groans and sighs:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the King from the depth of his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Begins sobbing, and wailing, and sighing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When quickly the water-fay over him bends,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With loving kisses replying.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a>{40}</span></p>

<p>Man is the slave of the kiss; by a kiss woman tames the fiercest man; by
means of a kiss man’s will becomes as wax. Our peasant girls in Denmark
know this, too, right well. When they want one of the lads to do them a
service they promise him “seven sweet kisses and a bit of white sugar on
Whitsunday morning.” “But he will get neither,” they say to themselves.</p>

<p>Now, as we have discussed the kiss and its importance as the direct
expression of love and erotic emotions, we will pass over to certain
more special aspects of its nature.</p>

<p>In the very first place, then, we have the quantitative conditions.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that lovers are liberal in the
extreme in the question of kisses, which are given and taken to
infinity, and these have likewise continually the same intoxicating
freshness as at the first meeting. Everything in love is, you know, a
reiteration, and yet love is a perpetual renewing. How inspiriting are
the words of Tove to King Waldemar, as J. P. Jacobsen gives them:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now I say for the first time:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">“King Volmer, I love thee,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a>{41}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss thee now for the first time,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fling mine arms round thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But should you say I’ve said this before,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And you to kisses are fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then say I: “King, he’s but a fool<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who minds such trifles vain.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>What has a love kiss to do with the law of renewal? That one does not
arrive at anything by <i>one</i> kiss is expressed with sufficient plainness
in an Istro-Roumanian proverb: <i>Cu un trat busni nu se afla muliere</i>
(with a single kiss no woman is caught).</p>

<p>This maxim holds good besides in the case of both men and women. But how
many kisses are necessary then?</p>

<p>There is a little Greek folk-song called “All good things are three.” It
runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your first kiss brought me near to the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your second kiss came my life to save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if a third kiss you’ll bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even death can bring me woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But, nevertheless, we may assume without a shadow of a doubt that he was
not satisfied with these three kisses&mdash;lovers are not wont to be so
easily contented. The Spaniards and many other nations besides say of
lovers that “they eat each other up with kisses;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a>{42}</span> but more than three
are certainly required for that purpose:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take this kiss and a thousand more, my darling,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">sings Aarestrup, but Catullus outbids him, however, in one of his songs
to Lesbia:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thousand kisses; add five score:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another thousand kisses more;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then best forget them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest any wight with evil eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our too close counting might espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dire mishap befall.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As we see, Catullus’ love has no trifling start over Aarestrup’s, and so
a later poet seems likewise to think that even his demands are quite
ridiculously small. “Nay,” says Joachim du Bellay to his Columbelle,
“give me as many kisses as there are flowers on the mead, seeds on the
field, and grapes in the vineyards, and so that you shall not deem me
ungrateful, I will immediately give you as many again.”</p>

<p>Du Bellay, moreover, bitterly upbraids the poet of Verona for asking for
so few kisses that they can, when taken together, be counted:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In truth Catullus’ wants are small,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And little can they really mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he could even count them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43"></a>{43}</span></p>

<p>I must, however, take Catullus’ part to a certain extent; he is not so
precise in his demands of Lesbia as Du Bellay makes out; in another poem
he asks her:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy kisses dost thou bid me count,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell thee, Lesbia, what amount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My rage for love and thee could tire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And satisfy and cloy desire?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And the answer runs:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many as grains of Libyan sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon Cyrene’s spicy land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From prescient Ammon’s sultry dome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sacred Battus’ ancient tomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many as stars that silent ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night the stolen loves of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, when the kisses thou shall kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have reached a number vast as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then may desire at length be stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e’en my madness be allayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when infinity defies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The calculations of the wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor evil voice’s deadly charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can work the unknown number harm.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This being the case, it is a divine blessing that, according to the
Finnish saying, “the mouth is not torn by being kissed, nor the hand by
being squeezed”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Suu ei kulu suudellessa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kāsi kāttā annellessa.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44"></a>{44}</span></p>

<p>But even if the mouth is not exactly torn, yet much kissing may be
almost harmful; but there is only one remedy to be found for this&mdash;“you
must heal the hurts by fresh kisses.”</p>

<p>Dorat, who may be regarded as a high authority on philematology,
expressly says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A second kiss can physic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evil the first has wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And Heine, whose authority in these questions should hardly be inferior,
holds quite the same theory:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you have kissed my lips quite sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then kiss them whole again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we till evening meet no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then hurry will be vain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You have still yet the whole, whole night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My dearest heart, know this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One can in such a long, long night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kiss much and taste much bliss.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I make use of the last of the verses quoted as a transition to the next
question we have to investigate, viz., the qualitative aspect of
kissing, as I regard it apart from its merely gustative qualities, which
have already been considered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45"></a>{45}</span></p>

<p>The love kiss gleams like a cut diamond with a thousand hues; it is
eternally changing as the sun’s shimmer on the waves, and expresses the
most diverse states and moods, ranging from humble affection to burning
desire.</p>

<p>The love kiss “quenches the fire of the lips,” quells and stills longing
and desire, but it also burns and arouses regret. Margaret sits at her
spinning-wheel, and, in tremulous longing, calls to mind Faust’s ardent
kiss:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My peace is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart is sore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis gone for ever<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And evermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the magic flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of his talk, the bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the clasp of his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, oh, his kiss!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My bosom yearns<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For him alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, dared I clasp him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hold, and own!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And kiss his mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To heart’s desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his kisses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At last expire!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a>{46}</span></p>

<p>Numberless poets have varied the theme of the quenching yet burning
kisses of love.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O’er me flows in streams delicious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kisses’ rosy and glowing rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">sings Waldemar at his meeting with Tove, and Aarestrup laments:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In vain I’m seeking<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In ev’ry land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sweetness burning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of mouth and hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This “burning sweetness” seems to be an indubitable characteristic of a
genuine love kiss; we even find it again in Heine:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world’s an ass, the world can’t see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy character not knowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It knows not how sweet thy kisses be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How rapturously glowing.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The emotions consequent on the first kiss have been described in the old
<i>naïve</i>, but, nevertheless, exceedingly delicate love-story, of Daphnis
and Chloe. As a reward Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis&mdash;an innocent
young-maid’s kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>{47}</span></p>

<p>“Ye gods, what are my feelings. Her lips are softer than the rose’s
leaf, her mouth is sweet as honey, and her kiss inflicts on me more pain
than a bee’s sting. I have often kissed my kids, I have often kissed my
lambs, but never have I known aught like this. My pulse is beating fast,
my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet,
nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected
pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed
me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?”</p>

<p>Impelled, as it were, by some irresistible force, Daphnis wanders back
to Chloe; he finds her asleep, but dares not awake her: “See how her
eyes slumber and her mouth breathes. The scent of apple-blossoms is not
so delicious as her breath. But I dare not kiss her. Her kiss stings me
to the heart, and drives me as mad as if I had eaten fresh honey.”
Daphnis’ fear of kisses disappears, however, later on, directly his
simplicity has made room for greater selfconsciousness. That a kiss is
like the sting of a bee, or pains like a wound, is a metaphor which many
poets have used, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a>{48}</span> the metaphor comes undoubtedly near the truth.
With growing passion, kisses become mad and violent:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy ruby lips, they kissed so wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So madly, so soul-disturbing;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and such kisses leave marks behind them. Aarestrup’s mistress has
beautiful plump shoulders:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They curve, as of a goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So naked and so bold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’ll brand your comely shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such guerdon have they earned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look where my lips enfevered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have scars of crimson burned.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Hafiz’ mistress is afraid that “his too hot kisses will char her
delicate lips.” With continually increasing desire kisses grow more and
more voluptuous, and assume forms which have been celebrated by poets of
antiquity and the Renaissance. Many burning, erotic verses have been
composed on the subject <i>columbatim labra conserere</i>, or kissing as
doves kiss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a>{49}</span></p>

<p>Kisses at last grow into bites. Mirabeau, in a love-letter to Sophie,
writes: “I am kissing you and biting you all over, <i>et jaloux de la
blancheur je te couvre de suçons</i>”; and the classic poets often speak of
the tiny red marks on cheeks or lips, neck or shoulders, which the
lovers’ <i>morsiunculæ</i> have left behind.</p>

<p>Arethusa writes to Lycas: “What keeps you till now so long away from me?
Oh, suffer no young girl to print the mark of her teeth on your neck.”
The Italians use the expression <i>baciare co’ denti</i> (kiss with the
teeth) to signify “to love.” We can only treat these kisses as a sort of
transitional link, of shorter or longer duration, according to
circumstances. They are, as it were, “a sea fraught with perils,” which
in Mlle. de Scudéry’s celebrated letter (<i>la carte de tendre</i>), carries
one to strange countries (<i>les terres inconnues</i>); but, as these
countries lie outside the regions of pure philematology, I shall not
pursue my investigations further. I will, however, first quote what old
Ovid has written, although I am not at all prepared to assert that his
opinion is entitled to have any special weight, more especially as it
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50"></a>{50}</span> far from being unimpeachable from a moral point of view:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oscula qui sumpsit, si non et cetera sumet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hæc quoque quæ data sunt perdere dignus erit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quantum defuerat pleno post oscula voto?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heu mihi rusticitas, non pudor ille fuit.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After the foregoing it would seem superfluous to enter into a closer
investigation of&mdash;if the term be allowed&mdash;the topographical aspects of
kissing. The love kiss is, as you are aware, properly directed towards
the mouth&mdash;a fact sufficiently known, and in testimony of which I have,
moreover, brought forward a number of passages from respectable and
trustworthy writers. I shall only add a German “Sinngedicht” of
Friedrich von Logau:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you will kiss, then kiss the mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All other sorts are but half blisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face&mdash;ah, no&mdash;nor hand, neck, breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mouth alone can give back kisses.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Von Logau’s vindication of the mouth as the only place that ought to be
kissed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a>{51}</span> extremely logical, and, I take it, from a purely theoretical
point of view, unobjectionable; but, practically, the case is quite the
contrary. The royal <i>trouvère</i>, Thibaut de Champagne, treats in a
lengthy poem&mdash;one of the so-called <i>jeux-partis</i>&mdash;the question whether
one should kiss one’s mistress’s mouth or feet. Baudouin’s opinion is in
favour of kissing her on the mouth, and he gives his reasons for it at
some length; but Thibaut replies, that he who kisses his darling on the
mouth has no love for her, because that is the way one kisses any little
shepherdess one comes across; it is only by kissing her feet that a
lover shows his affection, and it is by such means alone that her favour
is to be won.</p>

<p>The question of feet or mouth is threshed out minutely by the two
contending parties, who at last agree in the opinion that one ought to
kiss both parts, beginning with the feet and ending with the mouth.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Thibaut de Champagne has a far better insight
into the matter than Von Logau, and yet even the old French poet’s point
of view must be characterised as being somewhat narrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a>{52}</span></p>

<p>All the other poets, you must know, teach us that not only the mouth,
but every part of our sweetheart’s body says, “Kiss me.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Friends, if it only were my fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If fate would will it so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d kiss her beauties small and great<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From bosom down to toe.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So sings Aarestrup, and he returns again and again to the same idea in
his <i>ritorneller</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When scarce the mouth can longer feel such fooling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because thy lips are all too hotly burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press them to bosom’s Alpine snows for cooling.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The arms so white and tender woo caresses;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lovely pleasance, too, those plump white shoulders!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the soul a bosom-kiss straight presses.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her snow-white shoulders! All what may be said on<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such beauty I have uttered. For my guerdon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant me one now to rest my weary head on.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At kisses pressed upon your neck’s fair closes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You thrilled and threw your head back, and I straightway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planted upon your throat my kisses’ roses.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">About my darling I am wheeling, flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like to a gadfly round a lily’s chalice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buzzing until in nectar-cup mute dying.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Allow me also to call your attention to a pretty little myth which Dorat
composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a>{53}</span> about a “kiss in the bosom’s Alpine snow.” The kiss is a fair
rose, and roses bloom everywhere in these tracks; through witchcraft two
vigorous rosebuds sprouted forth on woman’s white bosom:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Le bouton d’un beau sein est éclos du baiser;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Une rose y fleurit pour y marquer sa trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fier de l’avoir fait naître, il aime à s’y fixer.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But if the object of one’s affection is not within reach, and <i>oscula
corporalia</i> are, for that reason, practically impossible, her image may
be kissed, as a French song naïvely says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will make a portrait gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like to thee, set in a locket;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiss it five score times a day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Guard it safely in my pocket.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But if one is not fortunate enough to possess an image of the object of
one’s affection, then anything that has in any way been associated with,
or is reminiscent of, him or her may be kissed. Tovelille exults to King
Volmer:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For all my roses I’ve kissed to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst thinking, dear love, of thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54"></a>{54}</span></p>

<p>But F. Rückert sings with pain and mockery:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With fervour the hard stone I’m kissing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your heart is as hard as a stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Such <i>oscula impropria</i> are often mentioned by ancient as well as modern
poets. <i>Propertius</i> (I. 16) says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, oft I’ve hither sped with verse to greet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thee, leaning on thy steps with kisses pressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How often, traitress, turning towards the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I’ve laid in secret garlands on thy crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Eighteen hundred years afterwards Dorat writes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I kiss the kindly blades of grass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because they have approached your charms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sands o’er which your footsteps pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And leafy boughs that stretched their arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide our happiness, dear lass.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Lovers often send each other kisses through the air, as in Béranger’s
well-known song on the detestable Spring:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We loved before we ever met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our kisses crossed athwart the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But should the distance be too great for such a platonic interchange of
kisses, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55"></a>{55}</span> small, obliging <i>postillons d’amour</i> are employed Heine
uses his poems for that purpose:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O would that all my verses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were kisses light and sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d send them all in secret<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My sweetheart’s cheeks to greet.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>While the young girl in Runeberg has recourse to a rose that has just
blossomed:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the grove amidst the blooming flow’rets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked the bonnie maiden unattended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she plucked a new-born rose, exclaiming:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Lovely flow’ret, if you’d only wings on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would send you to my well-belovèd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I’d fastened just two tiny greetings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly on your right wing and your left wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One should bid him cover you with kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the other send you back to me soon.’<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But however much poets may clothe with grace such kisses sent and
received by post&mdash;and it cannot be denied that many of them are
extraordinarily charming from a poetical point of view&mdash;they are, and
must be, nevertheless, in reality only certain mean substitutes with
which lovers in the long run cannot feel fully satisfied. “The kiss,”
says the practical Frenchmen, “is a fruit which one ought to pluck from
the tree itself” (<i>Le baiser est un<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56"></a>{56}</span> fruit qu’il faut cueiller sur
l’arbre</i>). Kisses ought to be given, as they should be taken, in secret;
only in such case have they their full freshness, their intoxicating
power. Heine says of such:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kisses that one steals in darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in darkness then returns&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How such kisses fire the spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If with ardent love it burns!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>No profane eyes should see them: they only concern the pair of
lovers&mdash;none other in the whole world. Secrecy and silence must rest
over these kisses, as over all else that regards the soul of love, so
that the butterfly’s wings may not lose their delicate down.</p>

<p>The strait-laced Cato degraded a senator of the name of Manilius for
having kissed his wife in broad daylight and in his daughter’s presence.
Plutarch, however, considers the punishment excessive, but adds: “How
disgusting it is in any case to kiss in the presence of third parties.”
Clement of Alexandria, one of the Fathers of the Church, endorses this
opinion, and exhorts all married people to refrain from kissing one
another before their servants.</p>

<p>All delicate-minded persons must undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57"></a>{57}</span> sympathise with the
ancient ascetic conception in proportion as they unconsciously follow it
in practice. A kiss to or from a woman we love is a far too delicate
pledge of affection to bear the gaze of strangers.</p>

<p>How many engaged couples would, do you suppose, find favour in Cato’s
eyes? How often do they not by their behaviour offend the commonest
notions of decency? Their kisses and caresses, which ought to be their
secret possession, they expose quite unconcernedly to the sight of all.
One evening at a large party I saw a young girl ostentatiously kiss on
the mouth the gentleman to whom she was engaged. Cato would certainly
turn in his grave if he knew that such immodest behaviour was actually
tolerated by people of refinement and position; and how disgusted and
indignant he would be&mdash;unless, indeed, he preferred to smile&mdash;at the
sight of the duty-kisses after dinner, which are often exchanged between
man and wife at dinner-parties. Ah, yes, when the belly’s full ...! How
warranted is Kierkegaard’s satire on the conjugal domestic kiss with
which husband and wife, in lack of a napkin, wipe each other’s mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a>{58}</span>
after meals. On the lips of youth alone you reap the sweetest harvests:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sur les lèvres de la jeunesse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tu fais les plus douces moissons.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">(<span class="smcap">Dorat</span>).<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The young maiden will only give her love-kiss to her sweetheart, the
stalwart swain; an old suitor is spurned with scorn. The lovely Mara,
white and red, walked by the spring and tended her sheep:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See an old, old suitor comes riding up on horseback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting: “God’s peace be thine, fair Mara, white and red.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, canst thou offer me a draught of cold clear water;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, can the basil ever verdant here be gathered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may I snatch a kiss from thee, fair Mara, white and red?”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But straightway comes the answer from fair Mara, white and red:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I charge thee, old, old suitor, to horse and ride hence quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No drink is here thy portion from the fountain cold and clear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor durst thou snatch a kiss from me, fair Mara, white and red.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59"></a>{59}</span></p>

<p>Again, fair Mara, white and red, walked by the spring and tended her
sheep:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Wouldst thou gather from the bushes, thou must hither come at mid-day,<br /></span>

<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In another Servian ballad we find the same glorification of the stalwart
young lover, the same contempt for, and detestation of, old men who go
a-wooing.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High upon a mountain’s slope once stood a maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mirroring her lovely image in the stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60"></a>{60}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her image in these words addressing:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gath’ring with my hands their bitter herbage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squeezing out of it its acrid juices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washed thee then therewith that thou should’st savour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bitterly wheresoe’r the old man kissed thee.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘O my lovely image, had I known that<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Squeezing from the roses their sweet juices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laved thee with them, O mine image, that thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Savoured of fragrance wheresoe’r he kissed thee.’<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A kiss must be given and taken in frank, joyous affection. To have
recourse to violence is unknightly, unlovely, and despicable in the
highest degree. This is a sphere wherein the brutal axiom regarding the
right of the stronger can never hold good. An Albanian folk-song tells
us of a young man who is in search of a young maiden with whom he is in
love; he finds her at a brook, and, against her will, kisses her mouth
and cheeks. Filled with shame, the young maiden tries to wash away the
kisses in the brook, but its water is dyed red, and “when the women in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61"></a>{61}</span> neighbouring village come thither to wash their clothes, the latter
turn red instead of white. And, in the gardens watered with water from
the brook, scarlet flowers sprout up; and the birds which drank of the
water thereof lost their power of song.”</p>

<p>This ballad shows us, in burning words, how deeply a man outrages a
woman when he kisses her against the dictates of her heart. A Southern
imagination alone can find an expression so sublime and poetical: in
French it runs simply and frankly: <i>Un baiser n’est rien, quand le
cœur est muet</i>. In Teutonic countries it is expressed somewhat more
awkwardly. In Denmark people say: <i>Kys med gevalt er æg uden salt</i> (a
kiss snatched by force is as an egg without salt); and in Germany still
less elegantly: <i>Ein aufgezwungener Kuss ist wie ein Hühneraug’ am Fuss</i>
(like a corn on one’s foot).</p>

<p>The question of kissing by main force can be treated not only from an
ethical, but also from a juristic point of view. Holberg relates that in
Naples the individual who kissed in the street a woman against her will
was punished by not being allowed to approach within thirty miles
distance of the spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>{62}</span> the outrage had taken place; and a German
jurist wrote in the end of the eighteenth century, a minute and
extremely solid treatise on the remedy that a woman has against a man
who kisses her against her will (<i>Von dem Rechte des Frauenzimmers gegen
eine Mannperson, die es wider seinen Willen küsset</i>). The author begins
by classifying kisses; he distinguishes between lawful and unlawful
kisses, and frames the following classification:&mdash;</p>

<p>Kisses are either</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>After this particularly happy attempt to reduce kissing to a system, our
jurist maintains the view that all depends on the person who kisses and
the person who is kissed.</p>

<p>If, for instance, a peasant or a vulgar citizen takes such a liberty as
to kiss a noble and high-born lady against her will, her claim against
the aggressor ought to be far greater than it would be in the case of
one of less ignoble descent; but, on the other hand, if Hans steals from
his Greta “an informal, hearty, rustic kiss,” and she complains to the
authorities about it, there will scarcely be any grounds for litigation.</p>

<p>On the whole, says he, a kiss between individuals of the same position
in society is not to be regarded as a tort, and he more closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a>{64}</span> defines
how he arrives at this conception. It can only be actionable in the case
of a party having some consciously unchaste intention when he kissed, or
in the case of an <i>osculum luxuriosum</i> or <i>libidinosum</i>&mdash;in such cases
only can a verdict be brought in of what, according to Roman law, is
termed <i>crimen osculationis</i>, and in no other case can the wrong-doer be
punished by fine or imprisonment, <i>propter voluntatem perniciosæ
libidinis</i>. The punishment, however, should be proportioned in severity
according to the rank of the injured party. In the case of a nun or a
married woman it ought to be most severe; less severe if the lady be
unmarried but betrothed, and mildest when she is neither married nor
betrothed.</p>

<p>But if the unchaste intention cannot be distinctly proved, the woman has
no grounds for complaining of any sort, and, in accordance with the
procedure of the German courts, the kiss is to be considered innocent
till the contrary is proved.</p>

<p>Our jurist thus takes a really liberal view in the case of a “kiss taken
by force”; he may almost be said to regard it as <i>eine grosse
Kleinigkeit</i> (an unimportant trifle).</p>

<p>With regard to the question of a woman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a>{65}</span> right to defend herself in
such cases, he is of opinion that she is justified in repulsing the
insulter by a box on the ears, but only if the offence amounts to
<i>crimen osculationis</i>, and this box on the ears may not be inflicted
with “the fist of an Amazon,” as, by such requital, she easily loses her
right to take legal action in the matter. She must, above all, be
careful that the box on the ears be not excessive (<i>die Ohrfeige
proportionirlich einzukleiden</i>), as otherwise the man can bring an
action against her; consequently the woman ought to use her right of
self-defence with great caution.</p>

<p>Our jurist concludes with considerations of cases when the woman who has
been kissed forfeits all claims, viz., when, for instance, by look or
gestures she says, “I should like to see the man who would dare to kiss
me,” and, by such conduct, obviously exposes herself to the danger.</p>

<p>Holberg has also occupied himself with this question, and tells the
following story in one of his epistles (No. 199):&mdash;</p>

<p>“Last week I was at a party where a curious incident happened. A person
stole up to a lady and gave her a kiss unexpectedly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a>{66}</span> Vestal virgin
took this <i>douceur</i> in such ill part that, in her wrath, she gave him a
sound box on the ears. He gave a start, and every one expected he was
going to pay her back in the same coin; but, to show his respect for the
fair sex, he made a low bow, and kissed the very hand that had but
lately struck him. All present praised this act of courtesy, on his
part.” Holberg, on the contrary, does not commend the man’s politeness;
like the German jurist, he sees nothing wrong about a kiss&mdash;indeed, he
even goes so far as to say that the young man ought to have given the
maiden a box on the ears in return. This coarse way of looking at the
subject from a bachelor’s point of view is wittily defended in the
following rather startling way:</p>

<p>“I candidly confess that if anything of the kind had happened to me I
should have returned the good lady’s salutation in the same way, and
that not out of anger or desire of being revenged, but for the purpose
of showing the courtesy with which one ought to treat a woman; for
kissing the lady on the hand which has boxed his ears is equivalent to
saying: ‘As you are a feeble creature of no importance, and cannot hurt
me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a>{67}</span> your act deserves ridicule rather than revenge or rage.’ No
sensible woman can be pleased with such a compliment, as there is
nothing worse than being treated like a puppet; and I hope no maid or
matron will take this opinion of mine in ill part, but will rather
regard it as a proof of the justice I have always shown to women by
always taking them seriously. A kiss is nothing but a salutation, and
cannot be looked on as anything else. We are no longer living in the
golden age, when a young lady almost fainted at hearing the word
pronounced.”</p>

<p>English ladies regard the matter from quite another point of view. In
1837 Mr Thomas Saverland brought an action against Miss Caroline Newton,
who had bitten a piece out of his nose for his having tried to kiss her
by way of a joke. The defendant was acquitted, and the judge laid it
down that “when a man kisses a woman against her will she is fully
entitled to bite his nose, if she so pleases.”&mdash;“And eat it up, if she
has a fancy that way,” added a jocular barrister half aloud.</p>

<p>Let us next consider how the thing stands when it is apparently only a
question of a kiss snatched by force&mdash;for it is, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a>{68}</span> a matter of
general knowledge that a woman’s “No” is not always to be taken
seriously. The refusal may, you know, be merely feigned. The maiden’s
“No” is the swain’s “Yes,” Peder Syv teaches us, and Runeberg, who also
understood women, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ev’ry girl is fond of kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she may pretend to scorn them.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If one is now convinced that the German proverb which says: <i>Auf ein
Weibes Zunge ist Nein nicht Nein</i> (On a woman’s tongue “no” is not
“no”), what then? Well, but how the point is to be finally settled is
not satisfactorily explained by the authorities within my reach; and
this is the reason why I dare not pronounce an opinion on the question
at issue. But I am convinced that the momentary difficulty will afford
the man the necessary diplomatic qualities as well as the requisite
tact. There is only one thing I can lay down for certain, viz., that if
a man follows his natural simplicity and reserve, and takes the girl’s
feigned “No” seriously, she will only laugh at him afterwards&mdash;such,
again, is woman’s nature.</p>

<p>A well-known French <i>chanson</i> deals with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69"></a>{69}</span> a hunter who meets a young
girl out in the forest. Struck by her beauty, he wants to kiss her:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And takes her by her white hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Intending to caress her;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">but she begins to cry, and, moved by her tears, he releases her; but he
has hardly got clear of the wood before she begins to laugh at him
heartily, and in derision shouts after him: “When you’ve got hold of a
quail you ought to pluck it, and when you’ve got hold of a girl you
ought to embrace her”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quand vous teniez la caille,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il fallait la plumer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quand vous teniez la fillette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il fallait l’embrasser.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I quote these verses, for they may possibly afford inexperienced young
men some matter for reflection.</p>

<p>Besides, a woman’s “No” has often a piquancy about it which lovers of a
somewhat more refined class set great store by. Even Martial (v. 46) has
expressed himself in favour of this in a little epigram which begins
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While ev’ry joy I scorn, but that I snatch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me thy furies more than features catch.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a>{70}</span></p>

<p>And Marot, who was likewise much skilled in “<i>ars amandi</i>,” even begs
his mistress not to give him her kisses readily:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mouth of coral, rare and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in kissing seems to bite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longed-for mouth, I pray you this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feign deny me when you kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Dorat has also expressed himself in favour of such. “Promise me nine
kisses,” says he to his Thais, “give me eight, and let me struggle for
the ninth.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first eight kisses you accord<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will crown my love’s felicity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I shall die in joy’s reward<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If for the ninth a struggle be.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even if the answer is not a decided negative, yet it can, you know, be
couched in such equivocal words as to be tantamount to neither a
permission nor a refusal. Many girls agree with the Swedish song:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But “yes” ’s a word I will not say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I either answer “nay.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is a saying in Jutland that runs thus: “Maren, may I kiss
you?&mdash;Guess. You won’t then, I suppose?&mdash;Guess once more?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71"></a>{71}</span> You
will?&mdash;But how could you guess it then?” This tallies capitally with the
following German saying: “<i>Zwinge mich, so thu’ ich keine Sünde,” sagte
das Mädchen</i> (“Constrain me, so that I shall not commit sin,” said the
maiden). Naturally in this case, there can be no question of any <i>crimen
osculationis</i>, for, as the jurists have it, <i>volenti non fit injuria</i>.</p>

<p>Let us finally examine all these kisses from an ethical standpoint. We
have all of us, you know, learnt from our earliest childhood that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He who kisses maidens hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very naughty habit;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and popular belief adds, by way of warning, that it causes sores on the
mouth. Ah, yes, that is certainly very true, but what becomes of our
childish lore in the main when we attain to somewhat riper age? Now,
only listen to the ballad about what happened in the case of the young
Serb, in spite of all he had learnt:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, so people told us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells a youth industrious,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Never kiss a maiden.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the young man harkens<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fairest maids he kisses.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>When so learned a man as our Serb succumbs to the tempting kiss, what is
to be said then about all the rest who are less instructed? And let us
remember ere we sit in judgment on any one&mdash;and it ought to be regarded
as peculiarly extenuating circumstances&mdash;that a woman’s mouth is a
direct incentive to kissing, that it is formed, as you know, for that
purpose, asserts an old troubadour, and created to kiss and smile:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when I gazed upon her red mouth sweet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That I lacked power to do aught or to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The roguish mouth with the white teeth and the moist red,
delicately-shaped lips say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a>{73}</span> every man who is not made of marble,
“Kiss me, kiss me”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her fresh mouth’s playing<br /></span>

<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>How human is Byron’s wish that all women had but one mouth so that he
might kiss them all at the same time:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That womankind had but one rosy mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss them all at once from north to south.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Runeberg has uttered a similar wish, and with a minute account of his
reasons:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I gaze on a bevy of damsels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m gazing and gazing incessant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fairest of all I’ll be choosing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet as to choice I’m uncertain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one has the brightest of bright eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another girl’s cheeks are more rosy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third one’s lips are the riper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth has a heart far more tender.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There isn’t a single maid lacking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A something that captures my senses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There isn’t one there I’d say “no” to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, would I might kiss the whole bevy!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even an ecclesiastic such as Æneas Silvius Piccolomini, when wishing to
describe how beautiful and fascinating a young girl was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a>{74}</span> writes that
“no one could see her without being seized at once with a desire to kiss
her.” So as not to shock my readers, I may mention that he wrote this
before he was made Pope and assumed the name of Pius II.</p>

<p>It ought now to be taken as proved that women&mdash;beautiful women&mdash;and
kisses are of a piece. It is at the same time nature’s ordinance, and we
find it verified in all countries and in all ages. Odin himself says,
you know, in Hávamál, where he instructs mortals in the wisdom of life:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ships are for voyages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shields for ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sword-blades to smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maids to kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And the Greeks sing: “Wine belongs to chestnuts, honey to nuts, and
kisses morning and night to young maids.”</p>

<p>I am inclined to assume that women also agree with this view; certainly
I have no positive enunciation to support my assumption, but I am able
to quote a German proverb which most assuredly points in this direction:
“<i>Ich kann das Küssen nicht leiden</i>,” <i>sagte das Mädchen</i>, “<i>wenn ich
nicht dabei bin</i>” (“I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a>{75}</span> bear kissing,” said the maiden, “when I am
not taking any part in it.”)</p>

<p>Now if, in spite of all I have quoted, some rigid moralist or other will
persist that kissing young maids is always a “bad” habit, and if,
peradventure, a still sterner moralist will maintain it is a sin into
the bargain, I should reply that, in any case, it is one of those sorts
of sin that are venial. The Pope himself will not refuse his absolution,
say the Italians, and they certainly ought to understand things in Rome.
“Kiss me,” runs an Italian folk-song, “the Pope will forgive you; kiss
me and I will kiss you, and the Pope will forgive us both.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O bella figlia, o bella garzona,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chè il Papa ci perdona tutti e dui.<br /></span>

<p>If the Pope is so complaisant then, to be sure, a subordinate servant of
the Church such as Aarestrup’s Father Hugo may well say:</p>

AFFECTIONATE KISSES</h2>

<p class="nind">A <span class="smcap">kiss</span> can also express feelings from which the erotic element is
excluded&mdash;feelings that are consequently less ardent and longing, but,
most frequently, far deeper and more lasting.</p>

<p>A kiss is expressive of love in the widest and most comprehensive
meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude,
compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow. In the first
place a kiss is the expression of the deep and intense feeling which
knits parents to their offspring. At its entrance into the world the
little helpless infant is received by its father’s and mother’s warm
kiss. In the Middle Ages they kissed the new-born baby thrice in the
name of the Holy Trinity. And the parent’s kiss follows the child
through life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a>{80}</span> When Hector takes leave of his wife Andromache he lifts
his little son up into his arms, but the child is afraid of his father’s
helmet, “of the gleam of the copper and the nodding crest of
horse-hair.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">And from his brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hector the casque removed, and set it down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glittering, on the ground; then kissed his child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And danced him in his arms.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Evangelist Luke tells the story of the Prodigal Son’s return home.
“But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”</p>

<p>The parent’s kiss is like the good angel which shields the child from
all evil. When Johannes in Sören Kierkegaard’s <i>Forførerens dagbog</i>
would describe the impression made on him by Cordelia he says, “She
looked so young and fresh, as if nature like a tender and opulent mother
had that very instant released her from her hand,” and he goes on to
say: “It seemed to me as if I had been witness to this farewell scene; I
marked how the loving mother once again embraced her and bade her
farewell; I heard her say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>{81}</span> ’Go out into the world now, my child; I have
done all for you. Now take this kiss as a seal upon your lips; ’tis a
seal the sanctuary preserves; no one can break it against your own will,
but when the right man comes, you shall understand him.’ And she presses
a kiss on her lips&mdash;a kiss which, not like a human kiss, takes aught,
but a divine kiss that gives all.” The chaste purity, which is
Cordelia’s halo and protection, is, as it were, the reflection of a
mother’s kiss.</p>

<p>It is for this reason also that in the <i>sagas</i> a quite irresistible
power is attributed to the parent’s kiss. When Vildering, the king’s
son, quits Maid Miseri and journeys alone to his parents to tell them
what has befallen him, she implores him to be especially careful not to
let his parents kiss him, “for should that happen, you will forget me
utterly.” In spite of his caution his mother kisses him, and oblivion
covers the past; he forgets his betrothed, who is sitting and waiting
for him in the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>Kisses of affection are exchanged not only between parents and children,
but between all the members of the same family; we find them even
outside the more narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a>{82}</span> family circle, everywhere where deep affection
unites people.</p>

<p>When Naomi bade her son’s wife farewell, “they lifted up their voice and
wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto
her.” When Moses went to meet his father-in-law, “he did obeisance and
kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came
into the tent;” and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau,
ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>The family kiss was also much in vogue with the Romans. Propertius, in
one of his elegies, chides his mistress for inventing quite <i>ad libitum</i>
a whole crowd of relations so as always to have at hand some one to kiss
her. This is how that came to pass: In ancient times there was a
so-called <i>jus osculi</i>, which allowed all a woman’s relations to kiss
her. There are several curious stories about this peculiar privilege.
The old traditions, which have been solemnly discussed by several
writers, relate that once upon a time women were forbidden to drink
wine; the above-mentioned law must have been instituted so that the
parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a>{83}</span> concerned should, in a pleasant and practical way, be able to
satisfy themselves about observing the prohibition. This highly
improbable explanation has been defended in a thesis for the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy even in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The kiss of affection is often mentioned by the early Greeks. Odysseus,
on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds, discloses his
identity to them, and shows them, as a certain proof, the cicatrix of a
wound that he had on one occasion received when out hunting:</p>

<p>We have another famous scene of recognition, but of far later date, in
the old French epic of Girart de Roussillon. Girart, after many years’
absence, returns in poverty and sickness to France. He presents himself
to the queen, who recognises him by means of a ring, and, “although it
was Good Friday, she fell on Girart’s neck and kissed him seven times.”</p>

<p>It would perhaps be superfluous to quote more instances of the kisses of
affection. We meet with it in all ages in grave and solemn moments, not
only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of
profound gratitude. When the Apostle Paul took leave of the elders of
the congregation at Ephesus, “they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s
neck and kissed him” (Acts xx. 37).</p>

<p>When De Malesherbes had solicited for himself the perilous honour of
undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a>{86}</span> the defence of Louis XVI., that monarch got up and, in
order to show his gratitude, kissed him publicly.</p>

<p>Even among persons who are utter strangers to each other, kisses such as
these may be exchanged. The profoundest sympathy with, the warmest
interest in, another’s weal or woe can be instantly created.</p>

<p>The story of Ingeborg Vinding and Poul Vendelbo Løvenørn is well known.
H. P. Giessing relates it, just as he heard it, in the following form:
Poul Vendelbo, the poor student, went one day on the ramparts round
Copenhagen, and walked with two rich noblemen who, like himself, had
matriculated at the university from Horsen’s School. They happened to
notice a singularly beautiful woman sitting at the window of one of the
adjacent houses. One of the noblemen then said half-mockingly to
Vendelbo, “Now, if you could get a kiss from that lady, Poul, we would
defray the expenses of that tour abroad which you are so anxious to
make.” Vendelbo took him at his word, went up to the beautiful lady, and
told her how his whole future possibly depended on her. She then drew
him towards the window, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a>{87}</span> the view of the nobleman, gave him the
kiss he craved. He went abroad, and, returning at last as
Adjutant-General Løvenørn, paid the fair lady a visit. She was none
other than Ingeborg Vinding.</p>

<p>This is the anecdote, equally characteristic of both parties, that Carl
Ploug has so prettily treated in his poem <i>Et Kys</i> (A Kiss).</p>

<p>The professor’s daughter is sitting alone in the sitting-room, and
“humming a song she has learnt by heart.” Then some one knocks at the
door, and in steps young Poul with his audacious request; first she will
refuse him indignantly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere yet a word she uttered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She raised her eyes again.<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It would be superfluous to say more about this poem, which I suppose is
the most popular of Ploug’s essays in epic narrative. How far the
anecdote is historical is uncertain; but with the knowledge we have of
his and her character it cannot, in any case, be regarded as improbable.
Ploug may thus be right when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A kiss has with its gentle flame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once kindled honour’s beacon high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kiss has given Denmark’s fame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A hero’s name that shall not die.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In early French literature there is a story somewhat akin to this; it
occurs in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a>{89}</span> miracle play of “<i>La Marquise de la Gaudine</i>.” In her
husband’s absence she has been falsely accused of adultery and thrown
into prison. Nobody dares to undertake her defence when, suddenly, a
knight named Anthenor steps up and offers, with sword in hand, to
undertake the defence of her innocence, having a long time back owed her
a deep debt of gratitude for having, on one occasion, saved his life by
a kiss. He himself tells us naïvely and ingenuously how it happened:
“Once upon a time I found myself, as you are aware, in peril of death;
the king suspected me and believed I aspired to his wife’s favour. Ah,
this was not the case at all, you know. But one day he said he would
believe me if I divulged to him who my sweetheart was. I did not know
what to do, and to save my life I said that the <i>marquise</i> was my
<i>amie</i>. He was not, however, content with this, but, as a proof,
demanded that I should take her by the waist in his presence and ask her
for a kiss. She gave it me and thus saved me from the snare the king had
laid. I shall never be able to repay her for what she has done for me.”</p>

<p>The kiss of affection is also bestowed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a>{90}</span> some person or thing that
excites detestation and abhorrence.</p>

<p>The legends of St Martin tell us how, on coming one day to Lutetia,
followed by a great crowd of people, he caught sight of a leper at the
gate of the city, who was so terrible an object to look at that
everybody turned away from him with loathing. To give those who followed
him a lesson in Christian charity, he went up to the poor sick man,
kissed and blessed him, and on the following morning the latter was
cured as by a miracle.</p>

<p>It is just through overcoming oneself in respect to that which is
intrinsically foul and repugnant that this kiss gets its high
significance and dignity. St Francis of Assisi had bidden farewell to an
existence of luxury, bestowed his wealth on the necessitous, and lived
the life of a beggar, but his conversion was still incomplete; he did
not become ripe for his great work of charity until he had overcome his
repugnance to the leprous. One day, when out riding, he met one of these
wretched sufferers, whose whole body was like a great open wound, and he
reined his horse aside in disgust; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a>{91}</span> shame overtook him at once, he
leapt off his horse, spoke kindly to the sick man, gave him what money
he had, and kissed both his hands. Such is the account given by the
historical chronicles, but the legend goes on to say that the leper
immediately afterwards vanished: it was Christ Himself who wished, in
this wise, to bestow His benediction on the noble and beautiful life’s
work of the saint.</p>

<p>The kiss of affection also plays an important part in folk-poetry; that
alone has power to cast off spells, that alone breaks all the bonds of
witchcraft and sorcery, and is able to restore man to his original
shape.</p>

<p>In the Scotch ballad of Kempion we are told how the Earl of
Estmereland’s daughter is persecuted by her wicked stepmother, who at
last by magic arts changes her into a snake:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cum heir, cum heir, ye freely feed<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I weired ye to a fiery beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And relieved sall ye never be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Kempion, the king’s son,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O meikle dolour did she dree,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And aye she cried for Kempion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gin he would but come to her hand.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>At last Kempion hears her voice, and straightway rows towards the foot
of the mountain:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of my stythe I winna rise,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">. . . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till Kempion, the king’s son,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cum to the crag, and thrice kiss me;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">implores the snake; but Kempion dares not. The snake coils in and out,
and the mountain is aflame; at last Kempion summons all his courage:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He’s louted him o’er the lofty crag,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The loveliest ladye e’er could be!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The same subject is found in the ballads of other countries. In the
Danish <i>Jomfruen i ormeham</i> the young maiden has been changed into a
little snake, compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a>{93}</span> wriggle in the grass. However, the knight
Jennus comes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">For both with much delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In another ballad the maiden has been turned by her stepmother into a
lime-tree, and makes her moan:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She changed me into a lime-tree, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bade me e’en in the greenwood stand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She bade me stand and hope for no bote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until a king’s son should kiss my root.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here have I tarried for years full five,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here have I tarried for years now ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor has a king’s son kissed me since then.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But at last the hour of her freedom arrives;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a>{94}</span> the king’s daughter has
heard the lime-tree’s lamentation, and she sends a message to her
brother, who comes at once:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hoisted his silken sail of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the salt sea on he sped.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The knight on his back a red cloak threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fared to the lime-tree without ado.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He kissed himself the lime-tree’s feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which straight became a maiden sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Corresponding poetical stories of the redeeming power of the kiss are to
be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example,
in the Old French Arthurian romances (<i>Lancelot</i>, <i>Guiglain</i>, <i>Tirant le
blanc</i>) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful
dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight
being brave enough to kiss her. This kiss is called <i>le fier baiser</i>.
From French the subject migrated to Italian literature, in which it was
taken up and made use of first in <i>Carduino</i>, later on in Boiardo’s
<i>Orlando innamorato</i>. The hero, after many perilous adventures, reaches
an enchanted castle where a young and beautiful maiden is sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a>{95}</span> by a
tomb. She tells him she can be released if he will venture to lift the
stone from the tomb and kiss what then appears. Without giving it a
second thought, the knight opens the tomb, and a horrible serpent with
hissing tongue and venomous breath darts forth. Trembling with fear, he
fulfils his promise, and that very instant the monster is transformed
into a lovely fairy who overwhelms her benefactor with recompenses. This
<i>motif</i> formed the subject of a drama in the last century by Gozzi in
<i>La donna serpente: fiaba teatrale tragicomica</i>.</p>

<p>Finally many folk-stories on this subject may be quoted. In the tale of
“Beauty and the Beast,” the transformed prince begged the young maiden
he had carried off on his back for a kiss. “No,” answered she, “how
could I kiss you who are so ugly and have seven horns on your forehead?”
Then the beast went its way, and she saw it no more till one day she
found it lying dead under a bush in the garden, whereupon she wept as
she had never wept before, and cast herself down on the beast and kissed
it. Then it returned to life, and the ugly beast became the handsomest
prince her eyes could see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96"></a>{96}</span> He then told her that he had been bewitched
by a wicked fairy, and could not be delivered unless a maid fell in love
with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.</p>

<p>In this case the kiss redeems from death, and likewise death itself is
nothing more than a great kiss of affection. When a human being quits
this earthly life it is God who takes His child in His arms, kisses it,
and carries it away from earth to brighter and more blissful spheres.</p>

<p>This highly poetical and beautiful conception of death has found
expression in Italian, where, instead of the word “die,” one can say,
“fall asleep in the Lord’s kiss” (<i>addormentarsi nel bacio del
Signore</i>). And this has got flesh and blood in an old legend of the
saints, where it is told of St Monica that, as she lay dying on her
couch, a little child whom nobody knew came and kissed her on her
breast, and straightway, as if the child had called her, she bowed her
head and breathed forth her last sigh.</p>

<p>The kiss of affection follows man even after death; with a kiss one
takes leave of the lifeless body.</p>

<p>In Genesis we read that when Jacob was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97"></a>{97}</span> dead, “Joseph fell upon his
father’s face and wept upon him and kissed him”; and it is told of Abu
Bekr, Mahomet’s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when
the prophet was dead, he went into the latter’s tent, uncovered his
face, and kissed him.</p>

<p>In the curious poem of <i>Ebbe Tygesøns dödsridt</i>, when the knight’s horse
carries his corpse back to his betrothed, it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She lifted up his gory head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And raised it to her lips to kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She swooned away, and fell back dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In very sooth, as she did this.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In ancient times lovers always demanded of each other this act of love.
“When the alabaster box, filled with Syrian perfume, has been poured out
over my dead body, then do thou, O Cynthia, press thy last kisses on my
cold lips,” sings Propertius in one of his elegies:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Osculaque in gelidis pones suprema labellis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cum dabitur Syrio munere plenus onyx.<br /></span>
<span class="i10"><i>Propertius</i> iii. 4, 29, 30.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And the same wish is expressed by Tibullus (I., i. 61, 62):</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mixta dabis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98"></a>{98}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You’ll weep for me, dear Delia, ere flames have caught my bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mingle with your kisses full many a bitter tear.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The death-kiss is something so natural that it is superfluous to point
out its existence amongst different nations. It was not only a mark of
love, but it was also an article of belief that the soul might be
detained for a brief while by such a kiss. Ovid, in his <i>Tristia</i>,
laments over his joyless existence in Tomis, whither Augustus had
banished him, and is in despair because, when the hour of death
approaches, he will not have his beloved wife by his side to detain his
fleeting spirit by her kisses mingled with tears.</p>

<p>The kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved,
and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether
world. Even in our own days, popular belief in many places demands that
the nearest relative shall kiss the corpses forehead ere the coffin lid
is screwed down; in certain parts, indeed, it is incumbent on every one
who sees a dead body to kiss it, otherwise he will get no peace for the
dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99"></a>{99}</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
THE KISS OF PEACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> kiss, as expressive of deep, spiritual love, also came to figure in
the primitive Christian Church.</p>

<p>Christ has said: “Peace be with you, my peace I give you,” and the
members of Christ’s Church gave each other peace symbolically through a
kiss. St Paul repeatedly speaks of the “holy kiss” (ϕίλημα ἄγιον), and,
in his Epistle to the Romans, writes: “Salute one another with an holy
kiss”; and he reiterates this exhortation in both his Epistles to the
Corinthians (1, xvi. 20, and 2, xiii. 12), and his first Epistle to the
Thessalonians (v. 26), wherein he says: “Greet all the brethren with an
holy kiss.”</p>

<p>The holy kiss has gradually found admission into the ritual of the
Church, and was imparted on occasions of particular solemnity, such as
baptism, marriage, confession, ordination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span> obsequies, etc., etc. At a
wedding the ceremony was as follows: On the conclusion of High Mass and
after the <i>Agnus Dei</i> had been chanted, the bridegroom went up to the
altar and received the kiss of peace from the priest. After this he
returned to his wife, and gave her the priest’s kiss of peace at the
foot of the crucifix. Reminiscences of this rite still survive in
several churches in England.</p>

<p>The holy kiss played an important part even at the Mass; in the Greek
Church it was imparted before, in the Roman Catholic Church after, the
consecration of the elements. The priest kissed the penitent, and
through this kiss gave him peace; this was the true kiss of peace
(<i>osculum pacis</i>). We have a peculiar memorial of this in Old Irish,
where the word <i>pōc</i>, which is derived from the Latin <i>pax</i>, means
“kiss,”&mdash;not “peace.” This change of meaning must, I suppose, be
attributed partly to a misunderstanding of the priest’s words when he
kissed the penitent: <i>Pacem do tibi</i> (Peace I give unto thee), <i>i.e.</i>,
people understood the kiss as the chief thing, and thought <i>pacem</i>
referred to that. The same peculiarity is again to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span> met with in
mediæval Spanish, where <i>paz</i> has also the meaning of “kiss.” In an
ancient romance which relates how Fernando dubbed the Cid a knight, it
says at the end, “He buckled a sword on his waist, and gave him ‘peace’
(<i>i.e.</i>, a kiss) on the mouth”:</p>

<p>The holy kiss occurs even in the early Christian love-feasts, the
so-called ἀγαπαί, and indeed was often exchanged in the church itself by
all the faithful without regard to sex, which gave the heathen cause for
scandal, and its use was restricted so that only men kissed men, and
women, women.</p>

<p>The kiss of peace was in vogue in France down to the thirteenth century.
We find it in the story about a very unpleasant incident to which Queen
Margaret, the wife of St Louis, was exposed. One day when she was in
church and the kiss of peace was to be imparted, she saw close beside
her a woman in splendid apparel, and taking the latter to be a lady of
rank, she gave her the kiss of peace. It turned out, however, that the
queen had made a mistake; she had kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span> one of the common courtesans
who always swarmed about the Court. She then complained to the king, the
consequence of which was that certain ordinances were drawn up with
respect to the dress of women of that class, in order to render all
confusion with respectable women henceforward impossible.</p>

<p>The kiss of peace in the churches seems to have been abolished in the
latter part of the Middle Ages, at different times in different
countries.</p>

<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century a special instrument for
conveying the kiss was introduced into England&mdash;the so-called
<i>osculatorium</i> or <i>tabella pacis</i>, which was composed of a metal disc
with a holy picture, and was passed round the church to be kissed.</p>

<p>From the English Church the osculatory was gradually introduced into
other churches, but nowhere does it appear to have contrived to rejoice
in any particularly long stay. In various ways it gave occasion to
scandal.</p>

<p>It was provocative of contention and strife in the church itself, when
people of position quarrelled violently as to whom the honour belonged
of kissing it first. Contentions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span> to precedence at church are, as we
see, of long standing.</p>

<p>It seems also to have served as a sort of profane intermediary between
lovers. When a young and beautiful girl kissed it she had close beside
her a fine young fellow who waited impatiently to take it directly from
her hand and lips. We read in one of Marot’s poems:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I told the maid that she was fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve kissed the Pax just after her.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Through the use of the osculatory, the well-known custom of gallants
such as, from the Greek romances and Ovid, existed in ancient times, was
revived&mdash;Huet calls it <i>elegans urbanitatis genus</i>&mdash;when the lover drank
out of the goblet from the very place which the beloved one’s lips had
touched. Formerly a sort of <i>pax</i> was employed even in Danish churches.
The Catholic priests showed the people “a picture in a book” (of course
the picture of some saint), and this picture was kissed by the
congregation; for which purpose a small fee termed “kiss-money” or
“book-money” was handed to the parish clerk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>{106}</span></p>

<p>Even after the use of the <i>pax</i> had been abolished by the Reformation,
the “book-money,” as a customary due to the clerk, was retained. But at
a congress at Roskilde in 1565, parish clerks were forbidden to demand
this fee.</p>

<p>The holy kiss is still imparted in the Greek Church on Easter Sunday;
all the faithful greet each other in church with kisses, and the words,
“Christ is risen,” the reply to which being, “Verily, He hath risen.” In
the Roman Catholic liturgy this usage has been confined to certain
masses, and the holy kiss is only exchanged among the clergy, not among
the members of the congregation. First, the bishop and archdeacon kiss
the altar, then the archdeacon kneels down and the bishop gives him the
kiss of peace with the words: <i>Pax tibi, frater, et ecclesiæ sanctæ Dei</i>
(Peace be with thee, brother, and with God’s Holy Church). The
archdeacon answers: <i>Et cum spiritu tuo</i> (And with thy spirit), after
which he gets up, genuflects towards the altar, and carries the kiss of
peace to the chief canon, whom he kisses on the left cheek with the
words <i>pax tibi</i>, and thus it is sent round to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span> all the officiating
clergy with many different ceremonies.</p>

<p>The holy kiss soon spread beyond the walls of the church, and came into
usage even in secular festivities. Thus, during the Middle Ages, it was
the custom to seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a
kiss. The old German poets mention such a kiss under the name of
“Vredekuss,” and so widespread was the custom of the kiss of
reconciliation, that the verb <i>at sone</i>, or <i>udsone</i>, got the meaning of
“to kiss.” <i>Sônen</i> has still this meaning in Frisian.</p>

<p>In an old French miracle-play St Bernard of Clairvaux says to Count
William and the Bishop of Poitiers, who had had a long-standing feud
with each other, and between whom he had managed to make peace: “In
order to show that your friendship is true and sincere, you must kiss
each other.” Count William then goes up to the bishop, saying: “My lord,
I crave your forgiveness for the wrong I have inflicted on you; I have
erred greatly towards you. Kiss me now to seal our peace, and I will
kiss you with loyal heart.”</p>

<p>Even knights gave each other the kiss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span> peace before proceeding to the
combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs.</p>

<p>In <i>Covenant Vivien</i>, Vivien exchanges the kiss of peace with Girart and
six other illustrious warriors before the great fight with King Desramé
begins.</p>

<p>Manzoni has made use of the kiss of peace in the pathetic scene in <i>I
promessi Sposi</i> (The Betrothed), when Fra Cristoforo obtains forgiveness
from the nobleman whose son he has slain. The nobleman receives the monk
in his palace. Surrounded by all his relations, he stands in the middle
of his great hall, with left hand on his sword-hilt, whilst with his
right he holds a flap of his cloak pressed against his chest. Cold and
stern, he gazes contemptuously and with suppressed wrath at the novice
as he enters, but the latter exhibits such touching remorse and noble
humility that the nobleman, there and then, abandons his stiffness. He
raises up the kneeling brother himself, grants him his forgiveness, and,
finally, “carried away by the emotion that prevailed, he threw his arms
round the latter’s neck, and gave and received the kiss of peace.”</p>

<p>After the Middle Ages the kiss of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span> disappears altogether as the
official token of reconciliation; solitary instances, indeed, can
certainly be quoted from Catherine of Medici’s Court, but they are
rather to be regarded as studied efforts to re-introduce an old and
abandoned usage. After the murder of Francis de Guise in 1563, his widow
and brother meet Admiral de Coligny; the latter swore that he had not
the least suspicion of the assassin’s plot, whereupon they kiss each
other, and mutually promise to forget all enmities, and henceforward to
live in peace and harmony. This kiss of peace was as powerless to revive
the old custom as Lamourette’s memorable attempt at the time of the
Revolution. On the 7th July 1792, when the quarrel amongst the members
of the Legislative Assembly had reached a terrible height, at the time
when the Austrian and Prussian armies were marching on Paris, Lamourette
got up and made a fervent patriotic speech, in which, in the most moving
terms, he exhorted all the members of the Assembly to sink their
differences. He finished by saying: “Let us forget all dissension and
swear everlasting fraternity”&mdash;<i>et jurons-nous fraternité éternelle</i>,
and the deputies at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span> fell into each others arms, and in a universal
kiss of reconciliation every one forgave each other’s wrongs. But this
unity did not last long. The quarrels began again the following day, and
two years afterwards Lamourette himself died by the guillotine; but the
expression, a kiss of Lamourette&mdash;<i>un baiser de Lamourette</i>&mdash;still
survives in the French language as a half ironical term for a
short-lived reconciliation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>{111}</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br /><br />
THE KISS OF RESPECT</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Margaret of Scotland</span>, who was betrothed to Charles the Seventh’s son,
the Dauphin Louis (afterwards Louis XI.), one day walked through a hall
where Alain Chartier was sitting asleep in a chair. On perceiving the
sleeping poet, she went up to him and kissed him on the lips. Many of
her suite were astonished at this, “for nature had, so far as Chartier
was concerned, suffered a beautiful and rich mind to take up its abode
in an ugly body.” The princess replied that they were not to marvel at
what she had done, for it was not the man she had kissed, but the mouth
from which so many golden words had proceeded. Margaret’s kiss was
therefore an expression of the respect she had for the poet, and the
admiration and regard inspired by his poetical genius. A little further
back in the Middle Ages we meet with another<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span> striking instance of a
kiss as expressive of veneration; but this kiss is of a more humble
nature. We are told that, when the Emperor Otto I. had taken leave of
his pious mother in the church attached to a monastery, the latter
followed him with her eyes as long as she could, and then returned to
the church and kissed the place whereon his feet had stood.</p>

<p>The kiss of veneration is of ancient origin; from the remotest times we
find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful&mdash;to the gods,
their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors;
out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon
were greeted with kisses.</p>

<p>In the first book of Kings God says to Elijah: “Yet I have left me seven
thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and
every mouth which hath not kissed him” (xix. 18).</p>

<p>In the thirty-first chapter of Job, Job extols his own piety: “If I
beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; and my
heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand” (26,
27). Here, undoubtedly, allusion is made to the kissing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span> hands
whereby the heathen were wont to salute the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>When the prophet Hosea laments over the idolatry of the children of
Israel, he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them.</p>

<p>Even in remote classical times a similar homage was paid to the gods;
people kissed the hands, knees, and feet, even the mouths, of their
idols. Cicero informs us, in one of his speeches against Verres, that
the lips and beard of the famous statue of Hercules at Agrigentum were
worn away by the kisses of devotees.</p>

<p>Bayle tells us, in reference to this passage, that a physician was asked
one day why it was that a bronze face could, in this manner, be worn
away through being kissed, whereas, on the other hand, kisses did not
leave the slightest trace on the countenance of the most fashionable
courtesan. His answer was that the reason, he supposed, was that statues
were kissed for centuries, but that the woman in question was only
kissed for a very few years, viz., so long as her beauty lasted. This
explanation was, however, considered unsatisfactory, and the physician’s
attention was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>{116}</span> called to the fact that soft flesh must be far sooner
worn away than hard bronze; besides, lover’s kisses being considerably
more violent than those of mere respect. The physician then urged
another reason, viz., that which kisses wear away from bronze lips is
lost for ever, but that which is worn away from living lips is
immediately replaced by renewal of tissue in the body.</p>

<p>The kiss of veneration came to play a very important part in Christian
society. St Luke the Evangelist tells us that when Christ sat at meat in
the Pharisee’s house there came a woman who had been a great sinner,
bringing with her a vase of ointment. “And stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment” (vii. 38). When the Pharisee wondered at His having allowed
such a woman to touch Him, He rebuked him by the parable of the two
debtors, and added, “Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the
time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou
didst not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>{117}</span></p>

<p>Again in the Psalms, “Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from
the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
that put their trust in him.”</p>

<p>C. H. Spurgeon used these lines as the text of a sermon he preached in
the “Music Hall,” London, on the 3rd of July 1859, in which he did his
utmost to make his congregation understand what is meant by saying we
are to “kiss Christ.” “The kiss,” says he, “is a mark of worship; to
kiss Christ is at the same time to recognise Him as God, and to pay Him
divine worship. The kiss is a mark of homage and subjection; we ought
likewise to acknowledge Christ as our King, and promise to follow
blindly His behests. The kiss is a sign of reconciliation; we ought to
show that we are reconciled with God. Lastly, the kiss is the greatest
of all tokens of love; to kiss Christ is therefore only a figurative way
of expressing to love Him with deep and fervent love.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As the woman that was a sinner showed her reverence for Christ by
kissing His feet, so all saintly men and women henceforward were
honoured in a like manner. They were saluted humbly by kisses on their
hands or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>{118}</span> feet, and the legend goes that he who kissed the hand of St
Dominic never afterwards committed sin. In many countries, more
especially in Southern Italy, kissing the hands of the priest is still
customary.</p>

<p>The kiss reverential was extended to everything that was holy, or had
been consecrated to sacred purposes.</p>

<p>People kissed the Cross with the image of the Crucified, and such
kissing of the Cross is always regarded as a particularly holy act. In
many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest
asseveration that the witness is speaking the truth, and as a last act
of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or
death-condemned to be kissed. Kissing the Cross brings blessing and
happiness. In the south of France people used formerly, in moments of
difficulty or danger, when no Cross was at hand, to kiss their thumbs
laid in the form of a cross. When devout Catholics salute the Pope by
humbly kissing his slipper, they are fond of explaining away this
greeting. They say that it is not to be taken as any personal homage
paid to the Pope; the kiss having nothing to do with his slipper, but
the cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>{119}</span> which is embroidered on it. Therefore Christ it is to whom
they are prostrating themselves. This idea, however, is undoubtedly a
later fancy; the kiss on the slipper ought, I take it, more correctly to
be considered as humble homage to the Pope as primate of the Church, and
such, therefore, must be the view the Pope himself holds, since he has,
times without number, exempted cardinals and other persons of high rank
from kissing his slipper. The number of kings and ambassadors who, in
the course of time, have refused to submit to this ceremony, have
undoubtedly regarded it as a humiliation; and popular conception bears
this out thoroughly. To “kiss the slipper” has become in many languages
synonymous with a low and unworthy cringing. In the old German war-song
against Charles V., we find:</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>People kiss the image of Our Lady. The legend tells us that John of
Antioch even dared to kiss Mary’s mouth, and this kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>{120}</span> gave him wisdom
and great eloquence, and spread a golden glory round his mouth, hence
his surname Chrysostom (golden mouth).<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>People kiss the pictures and statues of saints. Down in St Peter’s
church in Rome there is a remarkable old bronze figure of St Peter,
which is said to date from the fifth century, and the faithful have, in
all ages, shown the highest veneration to this image, in consequence of
which a great part of the right foot has been gradually kissed away.</p>

<p>Even nowadays the kiss bestowed on the pictures of the saints plays an
enormous part in the Roman Catholic, but more particularly in the Greek
Church. Not only their pictures, but even their relics are kissed; they
make both soul and body whole. St Balbina obtained forgiveness for her
sins by kissing St Peter’s chains, and Pascal’s niece was cured of a
disease in her eyes by kissing one of the thorns of Christ’s Crown. This
cure, the historical authenticity of which is, however, somewhat
doubtful, made a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>{121}</span> sensation, and provoked a violent controversy
between the Jansenists and Jesuits.</p>

<p>Besides, there are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their
health by kissing relics; innumerable, too, are the satires which arose
by reason of abuses in respect to cures which were achieved with relics
genuine and false. One of the best known is perhaps the mediæval story
of <i>The Monk’s Breeches</i>.</p>

<p>A Franciscan friar was a very intimate friend of a merchant in Orleans
and his wife&mdash;especially of the latter. One evening the merchant
returned home unexpectedly from a journey, and the friar, who had tried
to the best of his ability to entertain the wife in the husband’s
absence, for certain circumstances which were capable of being
misunderstood, thought it wisest to disappear as quick as possible; but
in his haste he forgot his breeches. The merchant, however, did not
notice anything; the night was dark, and next morning he even put on the
friar’s breeches instead of his own. On coming back home from his office
in the afternoon&mdash;he had long discovered his mistake&mdash;he demanded, with
violent and hasty words, an explanation from his wife; but the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>{122}</span>
who had discovered at once in the morning what had happened, hurriedly
sent a messenger to the friar to consult with him as to what was to be
done. According to their arrangement she answered her husband very
calmly:</p>

<p>“My dear friend, don’t fly into a passion; you ought to thank me instead
of quarrelling with me. You know we have no children, and we have tried
everything&mdash;but all in vain. Now I heard that St Francis’ breeches could
work miracles, even of that sort, and that is why I had them fetched for
you. Take them off now, for I expect some one from the monastery will be
coming for them directly.” The poor man in his delight quickly got out
of his breeches, and directly he had done so there came a knocking at
the door. It was the friar, followed by a choir boy carrying holy-water
and a censer. He had come to fetch the precious relic of the monastery,
and inquisitive neighbours flocked in from all quarters. He wrapped the
breeches reverently up in a white hand-cloth, and sprinkled them with
holy-water while the boy incensed them, after which he lifted up the
sacred bundle. Meanwhile all fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span> on their knees, and after pronouncing
a panegyric on St Francis, he himself carried round the breeches so that
the people who had assembled might kiss them. This they did with deep
piety and emotion, more especially the honest and grateful merchant.</p>

<p>This little story afforded much merriment in the Middle Ages. People
found much enjoyment in its burlesque humour, and never got tired of
hearing it. It occurs as a <i>fabliau</i>, a <i>farce</i>, and a story, and
belongs to the <i>facetiæ</i> with which the Pope’s Secretary, Poggio, amused
his friends in <i>Il Bugiale</i> (The Lie Manufactory).</p>

<p>Even as regards the great ones of this world the kiss used to serve in
various ways as a mark of humility and reverence. Its use in ancient
times was remarkably widespread; people threw themselves down on the
ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally “licked
the dust,” as it is termed. In the Psalms, Solomon sings of the promised
King: “They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
enemies shall lick the dust”; and the prophet Isaiah says: “Kings shall
be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing mothers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span> they shall bow
down to thee with their face before the earth and lick up the dust of
thy feet” (xlix. 23).</p>

<p>They kissed not only the ground under the powerful, but also their feet,
knees, hands, or the hem of their garments.</p>

<p>Certain Roman Emperors adopted these oriental usages. Thus Caligula
ordered people to kiss his hands and feet, and even in the Middle Ages
the custom of kissing the feet of kings was in vogue.</p>

<p>Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe
the kiss of respect. The Roman slaves kissed the hands of their masters;
pupils and soldiers those of their teachers and captains respectively.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages the vassal paid homage to his feudal lord by a
kiss on the hand or foot, hence the expression <i>devoir la bouche et les
mains</i>. It is well-known what befell Charles the Simple when Rollo, the
Norman chieftain, had to pay him feudal homage. The proud Viking would
not bow down to the king, but laid hold of the latter’s feet and lifted
them up to his mouth, whereat the king, amidst the laughter of the
spectators, tumbled down. Thus the scene is depicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>{125}</span> briefly and
graphically in the <i>Roman de Rou</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quant baisier dut le pie, baisier ne le deigna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La main tendi aual, le pie al rei leua,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sa bouche le traist e le rei enuersa;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asez s’en ristrent tuit, e li reis se dreça.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">They also kissed their liege lords on the thigh, and this method of
kissing can be traced down to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;
but the kiss on the hand was undoubtedly most frequently in use; and it
was the general custom for the vassal at the same time to hand his lord
a present, which is the reason why the word <i>baise-main</i> (hand-kiss)
gradually got this meaning.</p>

<p>If the lord was absent when the vassal waited on him, the latter had to
kiss the door, the lock or bolt, which was regarded as a valid
substitution for kissing the hand. From this arose the expressions,
<i>baiser l’huis</i>, (the door), <i>baiser le verrouil</i>, (the bolt), which
were used partly as an expression of slavish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span> subserviency, and partly
in an ironical sense of lovers who have been rejected by their
mistresses, and thus constrained to</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">As expressive not only of respect, but also of repentance, children in
former days were made to kiss the rod by which they had been chastised.
Geiler von Keiserberg writes in the sixteenth century: “When children
are thrashed they kiss the rods and say:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Liebe ruot, trute ruot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">werestu, ich tet niemer guot.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">“They kiss the rods and jump over them, yea they leap over them.” We
have a memorial of this custom in the phrase, “kissing the rod.”</p>

<p>There is still one great power that we have not mentioned, and one who
demands, too, homage by kisses, <i>i.e.</i>, the devil; but, in order that
the humility shown to him may be as great as possible, he must be kissed
on his behind, <i>i.e.</i>, on the place where the back ceases to be called
the back. Old pictures of the Sabbath on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>{127}</span> Blocksberg exhibit to us his
Satanic majesty, in the guise of a goat or cat, sitting on a high seat,
while his worshippers reverently approach and kiss him under his tail.
In several confessions of witches we find this kiss still more closely
described: “The devil has a big tail, and under it a sort of face, but
with this face he never speaks, as the only use he makes of it is to let
his most devoted followers kiss the same; for kissing this face is
regarded as an especially great honour.” This somewhat awkward kiss
occurs, moreover, in several sagas. In <i>Harehyrden</i> the Jeppe gives up
his magic flute to the king on condition that the latter kisses his ass
under its tail. It can also be shown in actual life, and we have some
anecdotes from the Middle Ages which seem to prove that the <i>podex</i>-kiss
was used as a derisory punishment. There is also a story told of a merry
knight, once upon a time, compelling a party of monks to pay their
respects to their abbot in the aforesaid less dignified way.</p>

<p>Kisses <i>in ano</i> seem also to have been required of neophytes on their
reception into certain secret societies.</p>

<p>The part this kiss plays in insulting speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>{128}</span> ought to be sufficiently
well known. The Romans ere now spoke about <i>lingere culum</i> or <i>lambere
nates</i>; the Germans more decently say: <i>Küss mich da ich sitz’</i> (Kiss me
where I sit), or <i>Er kann mich küssen da wo ich keine Nase habe</i> (He can
kiss me where I have no nose). Frenchmen even use the last mentioned
paraphrastic expression. It is told in an old poem about Theodore de
Beza, whose youth was, as you are aware, a very dissipated one, that, on
one occasion, he said of a lady that he would like to kiss her, but he
did not know how he could manage to do so as her nose was far too long.
When the lady learnt this she wittily replied:</p>

<p class="nind">We have no knowledge if this offer tempted the rigid Calvinist that was
to be; but the lady was undoubtedly young, and even if he had not found
her face so remarkably beautiful, yet it would have been very different
had the invitation come from an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>{129}</span> crone, as the well-known saying,
“<i>baiser le cul de la vieille</i>,” implies the deepest ignominy that can
befall a man, at any rate a gambler&mdash;viz., to lose without scoring a
point.</p>

<p>There is a Jutland variant of the story about Theodore de Beza: “I was
driving one day with Niels Hundepenge, and we saw at a distance a woman
walking on in front. Says Niels, ‘Peter, there goes a pretty girl; just
see what a figure, and how she steps out.’ When we got up to her we
found she was pock-marked and hideous. Then says Niels, ‘Now, my girl,
if you were only as good-looking in front as you are behind, I should
want to kiss you.’ ‘Well, if you think so,’ replied she, ‘you can kiss
me, you know, where you fancy I am best looking.’&nbsp;”</p>

<p>Allow me, in connection with this, to call your attention to a
peculiarity about the Latin word <i>osculum</i>. The first syllable os of
course signifies “mouth,” the two last, on the other hand, mean the
correlative part on the reverse side of the body. This circumstance has
been made use of in a Latin anecdote about a married lady. An
importunate suitor asked her for a kiss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>{130}</span> whereupon she replied that
this could not be granted, inasmuch as the first of what he asked
absolutely belonged to her husband, but, as she did not wish to be too
hard on him, he was welcome to have the last:</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>In modern times the ceremonious kiss of respect has gone clean out of
fashion in the most civilised countries; it is only retained in the
Church, but in all other domains it is practically unknown&mdash;so unknown,
indeed, that in many cases the practice would be offensive or
ridiculous.</p>

<p>Kissing the earth is another instance of such kisses that I shall quote.
It plays a part in the old stories about Junius Brutus. Together with
King Tarquin’s sons he journeyed to Delphi to consult the oracle. The
answer they received was that the supreme power would fall to the lot of
him who first kissed his mother. Brutus then made a pretence of
stumbling, and as he fell he kissed the earth, our common mother. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>{131}</span> few
years after this, the royal family were expelled from Rome, and Brutus
and Lucius Tarquinius were elected consuls.</p>

<p>People also kissed the earth for joy on returning to their native land
after a lengthened absence. When Agamemnon returned from the Trojan War:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stepped he forth inwardly glad to the shore of his well-loved country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing and kissing again his mother earth while the scalding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears down his cheeks were coursing, though his heart was brimming with blitheness.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even nowadays people feel glad at seeing their native country again
after long absence, but they have another way of expressing their joy,
and, without exaggeration, it would be safe to assert that if any one
returning from a journey wished to emulate Agamemnon, that person would
undoubtedly be put down as mad.</p>

<p>We find in Holberg (“Ulysses of Ithaca,” or “A German Comedy”) a parody
of the old usage, where Ulysses says: “Let us fall down, after the old
hero’s fashion, and kiss our mother earth.” They fall down and kiss the
ground, but Chilian gets up hurriedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>{132}</span> and says: “The deuce! I don’t
really understand the use of these ceremonies. Eugh, somebody has been
here before&mdash;that I can plainly perceive.”</p>

<p>The old custom now only survives in certain sayings. Frenchmen use the
expression <i>baiser la terre</i> (to kiss the earth), jeeringly, of a person
falling; and the German, <i>die Erde küssen</i> (to kiss the earth), is a
euphemistic way of saying “die.” I may add, for the sake of
completeness, that kissing the earth still occurs sporadically nowadays
in the sense of the profoundest humility mingled with regret. When
Raskolnikow, in Dostojewski’s novel of that name, has confided to Sonja
how he murdered the old usurer’s wife, he exclaims in his despair: “And
what shall I do now?”&mdash;“What shall you do now,” exclaims Sonja, and her
eyes flash: “Get up, go hence at once; station yourself at a crossway,
kneel down and kiss the earth you have defiled, bow down thus before all
the people, and say to them: ‘I have committed murder.’ Then God shall
give you new life.” And, finally, when Raskolnikow has determined
publicly to acknowledge his crime and denounce himself as a murderer, he
falls prostrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>{133}</span> on his knees in the middle of the market-place, bows
down, and, amidst the laughter and derision of the bystanders, kisses
the dirty ground with ecstasy and delight.</p>

<p>In Europe, at least, we no longer kiss the ground before the feet of the
mighty, any more than we salute them by kissing their hands or feet; a
bow more or less gracious, according to circumstances, serves the same
purpose generally. Nevertheless, at certain courts, such as the Spanish,
English, and Russian, kissing the hand is still customary as a sort of
ceremonial salutation; but its practice is usually confined to certain
solemn occasions.</p>

<p>Individuals of princely rank excepted, the kiss of respect to superiors
is to be regarded as all but extinct; but even in the eighteenth
century, kissing the hem of their garments is mentioned as a salutation
befitting ladies of exalted rank, and in Holberg’s <i>Politiske
Kandestøber</i> (the Political Pewterer), we see how Madame Abrahamsen and
Madame Sanderus even kissed Gedske on the apron.</p>

<p>Kissing, as expressive of admiration, still undoubtedly occurs, but can
scarcely be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>{134}</span> to be particularly general; it becomes less and less
common as we approach our own time.</p>

<p>A half-ironical instance occurs in Molière; in <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>
Armande and Philaminte fall into raptures over Vadius’ great learning.
<i>Du grec! O ciel! du grec! Il sait du grec, ma sœur!</i> (Greek! good
heavens! Greek! He knows Greek, sister), says the one, and the other
answers: <i>Du grec! quelle douceur!</i> (Greek! how sweet!). In their
boundless enthusiasm they ask Vadius to let them kiss him as a mark of
their admiration. He accepts this salutation very politely, if not with
any particularly great joy; but when he turns to young Henriette, from
whose lips he is especially desirous of receiving so tender an
expression of admiration, she rejects him quite abruptly with the
remark: <i>Excusez-moi, monsieur, je n’entends pas le Grec</i> (Excuse me,
sir, I don’t understand Greek).</p>

<p>The pedantic Vadius got just what he deserved&mdash;a kiss as dry as dust
from two middle-aged, sexless blue-stockings, which nobody begrudges
him. On the other hand, many, perhaps, will read with envy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>{135}</span>
homage received by Benjamin Franklin at the French Court. Mme. de
Campan, in her <i>Mémoires</i>, says: “At one of the splendid entertainments
given in Franklin’s honour, I saw how the most beautiful of the three
hundred ladies present was chosen to place a laurel crown on the white
locks of the American philosopher and imprint a kiss on each of the old
man’s cheeks.”</p>

<p>The kiss of admiration and respect has, I suppose, been the longest to
survive in the form of kissing ladies’ hands. Formerly, in many
countries, it constituted a friendly greeting on meeting a lady or
saying good-bye to her; but nowadays this custom has grown obsolete in
most places; nevertheless we have certain literary reminiscences of it.
In Austria people say <i>Küss die Hand, gnädige Frau</i>, and <i>Sârut mâna</i> in
Roumania, but still it is comparatively rare that this expression is
followed by actual kisses, as was formerly the case. <i>Je vous baise les
mains</i> is now only used in an ironical sense in France. Ceremonial
kisses, however, still flourish in Spain to a marked degree, not only in
the language of the Court, but also in general conversation. When I was
first presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>{136}</span> to a Spanish lady I expressed my gladness at making her
acquaintance by kissing her hand&mdash;only, however, by figure of
speech&mdash;but her husband at once pointed out to me in a laughing way,
that I had failed to show her proper respect. One can only kiss a
Spanish lady’s feet: <i>Beso à usted los pies</i> or <i>à los pies de usted</i> (I
kiss your feet), as they say.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the kiss reverential I will mention two
different ways in which it has been used. Formerly it was the custom, at
least at the French Court, for pages to first kiss the articles they
were to hand to distinguished personages. Henri Estienne tells an
anecdote about a page who had to carry a letter to the Princess of
Naples. It was expressly enjoined on him to kiss it (<i>baisez-la</i>), but
the page pretended he had misunderstood the words, so when he had to
leave the letter he first kissed the unsuspecting princess.</p>

<p>We find another peculiar form of the kiss reverential in the cases when
a person kisses his own hand before offering it to the guest he would
especially honour, or before accepting a present for which he wishes to
show<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>{137}</span> his gratitude in an extraordinarily polite manner.[A]</p>

<p>In an old comedy of Marivaux, “<i>Harlequin poli par l’Amour</i>,” a fairy
falls in love with a rustic lout. She carries him off, entertains him in
her castle, and tries in every possible way to gain his love; but he
remains utterly callous to all her blandishments, and behaves all the
time in a most foolish manner. He takes a fancy to a valuable ring the
fairy is wearing; she removes it from her finger and gives it to him,
but when he scarcely says “Thank you” for it, she says to chide him:
<i>Mon cher Arlequin, un beau garçon comme vous, quand une dame lui
présente quelque chose, doit baiser la main en la reçevant</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Arlequin takes hold of the fairy’s hand and kisses it; but she corrects
him again, and says: “He does not understand me once, but I like his
mistake. It is your own hand, you know, that you should kiss.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This usage still prevails amongst old peasants in Jutland, and is termed
receiving something with “kissed hand,” or “kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>{138}</span> hand.” The expression
<i>Kusshand</i> is also employed in German, and is explained thus: “Gruss,
wobei man die eigne Hand küsst und dann nach der zu grüssenden Person
hin bewegt oder sie reicht.” The same sort of greeting is found both in
England and France. Voltaire tells us that children in certain countries
are taught to kiss their right hand when anybody gives them something
good. Even at the present day, in certain places on the Alps, peasants
express their thanks by kissing their hand before taking what is given
to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>{139}</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
THE KISS OF FRIENDSHIP</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> kiss is also employed as a conventional salutation between persons
who only stand on a footing of friendship or acquaintance with each
other. In our northern countries the friendly kiss usually occurs only
between ladies, but in this instance its usage is very widely extended.
With men and women it is properly only allowable when there is a marked
difference in age between both parties, but, on the other hand, it
seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of
royal personages who, on solemn occasions, are wont to greet and take
leave of each other with more or less sincere kisses of greeting and
farewell. Here we find ourselves again in a sphere in which, alas, we
have sadly fallen away from the good old ways. In former times, to wit,
the friendly kiss was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>{142}</span> common with us between man and man as well
as between persons of opposite sexes. In guilds it was customary for the
members to greet each other “with hearty handshakes and smacking
kisses,” and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed
both their hosts and hostesses. In a description of a wedding in the
olden time in the district of Voer in Denmark we read:</p>

<p>“When they had eaten, the parish clerk got up first, put his arms round
the parson’s neck, and kissed him on the mouth, saying: <i>Tak for mad,
hr. pastor</i> (Thanks for your hospitality, sir priest). Then the parson
planted himself against a chest of drawers, and all the women, old and
young, went up to him, one after the other, and kissed him on the mouth.
Some of the old goodies could not quite reach him, for the priest was a
big, tall man, and they had actually to climb on to his boots, though he
stooped down to them slightly.” Peder Havgård said that he would not
have cared much to be in the parson’s place, for it was a mean and poor
country thereabouts, and some of the women were very shabbily-dressed
and dirty-looking.</p>

<p>If we glance outside Denmark it appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>{143}</span> that the kiss of friendship is
considerably in vogue. In Iceland it is still a general form of
salutation, although of late years there is said to be a certain falling
off in its use; and every one who travels in South Germany and Austria
can study at the very first railway station the different forms of that
kind of kiss which in those countries is specially used by way of
leave-taking; officers and students, farmers and merchants, all treat
each other to sounding kisses, usually on the cheek. One can observe the
same sort of thing in France, but more especially in Italy. I can attest
from personal experience that it is looked upon as the most natural
thing in the world for people to kiss their intimate friends when saying
good-bye, a shake of the hand being far too cold a leave-taking beneath
the warm sky of Italy.</p>

<p>It is, however, undoubted that, speaking generally, the custom of
kissing, as an ordinary greeting, has immensely declined; in ancient
times and in the Middle Ages it was much more frequent than nowadays.</p>

<p>It was the common practice with the Hebrews for acquaintances, when they
met, to kiss each other on the head, hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>{144}</span> shoulders; and it was
assuredly with a kiss of pretended friendship that Judas betrayed his
Master.</p>

<p>Even the Greeks in former times used kissing as a common salutation; not
only friends and acquaintances kissed each other, but also persons who
quite accidentally met when they were travelling.</p>

<p>The custom of kissing, however, became less general later on. In a
discourse of Dion Chrysostomus, called <i>From Eubœa</i>, or “The Hunter,”
is a story of a rustic coming to the city and meeting two acquaintances
in the assembly, whom he goes up to and kisses. “But,” says the rustic,
“people laughed prodigiously at my kissing them, and, on that occasion,
I learnt that it is not customary for people of the city to kiss each
other.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Kissing seems to have been much more in vogue with the Romans, amongst
whom it was the usual custom for people to salute each other with a kiss
on the hand, the cheek, or the mouth. Many even scented their mouths in
order to render their kisses more pleasing&mdash;or less unpleasant. Martial
laments<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>{145}</span> over this usage in a little epigram to Posthumus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What’s this that myrrh doth still smell in thy kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that with thee no other odour is?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis doubt, my Posthumus, he that doth smell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweetly always, smells not very well.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This kissing of friends gradually became a veritable nuisance to the
country. Fashion ordained that every one should give and receive such
kisses, but, in reality, every one preferred evading them. Martial, in
another epigram to this same Posthumus, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Posthumus late was wont to kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With one lip, which I loth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now my plague redoubled is,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He kisses me with both.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Posthumus’ kisses some must have,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And some salute his fist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hand, good Posthumus, I crave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I may choose my list.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Under such frightful circumstances people had recourse to shifts which
seem almost as unsavoury as the kisses they would escape:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why on my chin a plaster clapped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besalved my lips, that are not chapped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philænis, why? The cause is this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philænis, thee I will not kiss.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>{146}</span></p>

<p>But such artifices, however, are of very little use; no one escapes the
<i>basiatores</i> (kissers). They prowl about the streets and market-places;
not even the walls of the home, nor even the enforced solitariness of
the most hidden-places served as a protection against them:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are no means the kissing tribe to shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They meet you, stop you, after you they run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press you before, behind, to each side cleave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No place, no time, no men, exempted leave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dropping nose, salved lips, can none reprieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gangrenes, foul running sores, no one relieve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They kiss you in a sweat, or starved with cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovers’ their mistress’ kisses cannot hold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chair is no defence, with curtains guarded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With door and windows shut, and closely warded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kissers, through a chink will find a way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presume the tribune, consul’s self, to stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can the awful rods, or Lictor’s mace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stounding voice away these kissers chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they’ll ascend the Rostra, curule chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judges kiss while they give sentence there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those laugh they kiss, and those that sigh and weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis all the same whether you laugh or weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who do bathe, or recreate in pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who are withdrawn to ease themselves at stool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against this plague I know no fence but this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make him thy friend whom thou abhorr’st to kiss.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">All greet one another with kisses; every condition of life, every
handicraft, found a representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>{147}</span> amongst the <i>basiatores</i>. When a
man, in ancient times, was afraid of meeting his tailor, it was not so
much on account of the latter’s bill as by reason of his kisses.</p>

<p>“Rome,” says Martial, “gives, on one’s return after fifteen years’
absence, such a number of kisses as exceeds those given by Lesbia to
Catullus. Every neighbour, every hairy-faced farmer, presses on you with
a strongly-scented kiss. Here the weaver assails you, there the fuller
and cobbler, who has just been kissing leather; here the owner of a
filthy beard, and a one-eyed gentleman; there one with bleared eyes, and
fellows whose mouths are defiled with all manner of abominations. It was
hardly worth while to return.”</p>

<p>People kissed whenever they met: morning and evening, at all seasons of
the year: spring and autumn, summer and winter. The winter kisses seem
to have been especially unpleasant, and Martial censures them, in the
strongest terms, in his epigram to Linus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Tis winter, and December’s horrid cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes all things stark; yet, Linus, thou lay’st hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all thou meet’st; none can thy clutches miss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with thy frozen mouth all Rome dost kiss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>{148}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could’st more spiteful do, or more severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had’st thou a blow o’ th’ face, or box o’ th’ ear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wife, this time, to kiss me does forbear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My daughter, too, however debonaire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou more trim and sweeter art. No doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ icicles, hanging at thy dog-like snout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The congealed snivel dangling on thy beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranker than th’ oldest goat of all the herd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nastiest mouth i’ th’ town I’d rather greet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than with thy flowing frozen nostrils meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If therefore thou hast either shame or sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till April comes no kisses more dispense.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>That Martial’s epigrams depict the actual state of the case without any
particular exaggeration it may, among other things, be inferred from the
fact that the Emperor Tiberius, according to Suetonius, issued an edict
against these <i>cotidiana oscula</i> (daily kisses).</p>

<p>The friendly kiss was likewise much in vogue in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In <i>La Chanson de Roland</i> the Saracen king receives Ganelon with a kiss
on the neck, and then displayed to him his treasures:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quant l’ot Marsilies, si l’ad baisiet el’ col;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pois, si cumencet à uvrir ses trésors.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">(603).<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And Ganelon salutes the Saracen chiefs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>{149}</span> the same way, and “they
kissed each other on face and chin”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Bien serat fait”&mdash;li quens Guenes respunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pois, se baisièrent es vis e es mentuns.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">(625, 628).<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The friendly kiss is, on the whole, pretty often mentioned in the Old
French epics. “Out of friendship he kissed him on the mouth” is a verse
that frequently recurs:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Par l’amistiet l’en baisat en la buche.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The kiss of friendship was also exchanged between the opposite sexes. It
was the general custom for ladies to salute with a kiss any stranger
whether he came as an ambassador, expected guest, or a chance passer-by.
In the old French mystery-play of St Bernard de Menton, the Lord of
Miolan is sitting one day with his wife and daughters in the hall of his
castle, when a squire steps in and announces that some strangers have
arrived. The lord of the castle receives them courteously, bids them
welcome in God’s name, and at once orders his wife do her duty to them.
She, too, bids them welcome, and kisses them; at last it comes to the
turn of the little girls, who assure their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>{150}</span> father that they know their
duty right well, and are even willing to perform it:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A vostre bon commandement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les bayserons et festoyrons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trestons le myeulx que nous pourrons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mon seigneur, à vostre talent.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Which may be rendered thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As it is your orders dear,<br /></span>

<p>Whereupon they kiss the strange gentlemen. In the poem of “Huon de
Bordeaux” we are told how Huon’s mother, the Duchess of Bordeaux,
receives the French king’s embassy with kisses. The queen, in Marie de
France’s <i>Lai de Graelan</i>, sends an ambassador after Graelan to make his
acquaintance, and, when he arrives, goes to meet him, and kisses him on
the mouth.</p>

<p>In other Romance countries, too, kissing serves as a common mode of
greeting, which fact can be incidentally substantiated by means of
philology, inasmuch as the Latin verb <i>salutare</i> (‘to greet’) both in
Spanish and Roumanian, and partially in French, has acquired the meaning
of ‘to kiss.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>{151}</span></p>

<p>When Abengalvon, in the old <i>Pöema del Cid</i>, meets Minaya Alvar Fañez,
he advances smilingly towards him in order to kiss him, and he “greets”
him on the shoulder, “for such was his wont”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sonrisando de la boca, ibalo abrazar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En el ombro lo saluda, ca tal es su usaje.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The expression “to greet on the mouth” likewise occurs many times; but
also the verb <i>saludar</i> (‘to hail’) is also used alone, as in the
Roumanian <i>sâruta</i>, to express ‘to kiss.’</p>

<p>Even in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the friendly kiss
flourished in France. When Leo Rozmital, the Bohemian nobleman, paid his
respects to Louis XI. at Meung-sur-Loire, the king led him to the queen,
and both she and all the ladies of her court kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>We get further information in a letter from Annibale Caro dated 29th
October, 1544. It is addressed to the Duke of Palma, and describes the
visit of the French Queen Eléonore to the Emperor Charles V. in
Brussels. “When we met,” says he, “the ceremony of reception with
kissing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>{152}</span> ladies was, in the highest degree, interesting; it
seemed as if I had been present at the Rape of the Sabines. Not only the
higher nobility, but even all the rest took each his lady, and the
Spaniards and Neapolitans were the most eager. It gave rise to much
merriment when the Countess of Vertus, Charlotte de Pisseleu, was
observed to lean over her saddle to such an extent, in order to kiss the
Emperor, that she slid off her horse, and kissed the earth instead of
His Majesty’s mouth. The Emperor hurried up to her assistance, and with
a smile kissed her heartily (<i>e ridendo la baciò saporitamente</i>).
Directly afterwards Duke Ottavio rode up, jumped quickly off his horse,
and the Emperor himself conducted him to the Queen’s carriage, and there
he was presented to the distinguished ladies. The Duke kissed the
Queen’s hand and was about to remount his charger, but the Emperor
called him back, and told him that he ought also to kiss Mdme.
d’Etampes, who was sitting right opposite to the Queen in the carriage.
Like a good Frenchman, he exceeded the Emperor’s order and kissed her on
the mouth.”</p>

<p>A vast quantity of other evidence goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>{153}</span> show how general was the
friendly kiss of salutation even during the Renaissance, especially
among the upper classes. Henri Estienne satirises it in his <i>Apologie
pour Hérodote</i>. “Kisses are allowed,” writes he, “in France between
noblemen and ladies, whether they do or do not belong to the same
family. If a high-born dame is in church, and any fop of her
acquaintance comes, she must, in conformity with the usage prevailing in
good society, get up, even if she be absorbed in the deepest devotion,
and kiss him on the mouth.”</p>

<p>Even Montaigne expresses his disapproval of such a state of things. “It
is,” says he, “a highly reprehensible custom that ladies should be
obliged to offer their lips to every one who has a couple of lackeys at
his heels, however undesirable he may be, and we men are no gainers
thereby, for we have to kiss fifty ugly women to three pretty ones.”</p>

<p>None the less, the friendly kiss held its ground right through the
seventeenth and even a part of the eighteenth century. Molière’s
marquesses kiss each other whenever they meet; for instance, in the
famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>{154}</span> eleventh scene in <i>Les Précieuses ridicules</i>, when Mascarille
and Jodelet fall into each other’s arms with many warm kisses. In <i>Le
Misanthrope</i> Alceste reproaches Philinte with embracing and kissing
every one, and “when I ask you who it is, you scarcely know his name!”</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>La Bruyère has, time after time, satirised this foolish custom, which,
especially at Court, seems to have assumed colossal dimensions; but even
in middle-class circles etiquette required men to salute ladies with a
kiss.</p>

<p>In an old comedy entitled <i>Le Gentilhomme guespin</i> a father presents his
son, who is extraordinarily awkward and clumsy. The latter does not know
how he ought to behave to the ladies of the house, so the father in
despair gives him a dig in the ribs, and whispers in his ear: “He’s
bashful. Kiss the lady. One always greets a lady with a kiss.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>{155}</span></p>

<p>Molière has made use of this scene in <i>Le Malade imaginaire</i>, where
Thomas Diafoirus pedantically asks when he is introduced to Angélique:
<i>Baiserai-je?</i> (Am I to kiss?).</p>

<p>In England we come across pretty nearly the same state of things.
Erasmus of Rotterdam, in one of his <i>Epistolæ familiares</i>, expresses his
great satisfaction with English customs: “When you arrive every one
kisses you; at your departure they bid you good-bye and kiss you; you
come back, then fresh kisses. You are kissed when you meet any one, and
so, too, when you separate. Wheresoever you go everything is filled with
kisses, and if you have only once tasted how delicate these kisses are,
and the deliciousness of their savour, you would want, my dear Faustus,
to be banished to England for time and eternity.” In another passage,
where Erasmus is speaking of the state of the inns in England, which he
mentions in terms of unqualified praise, he winds up as follows:
“Everywhere at the inns one meets with pretty, smiling girls: they come
and ask for one’s soiled clothes; they wash them and soon bring them
back again. When the travellers are about to resume their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>{156}</span> journey these
girls kiss them, and take as affectionate a farewell of them as if the
latter were their brothers or near relations.”</p>

<p>And Holberg in his letter writes: “In England it is considered
uncourteous to enter a house without saluting one’s hostess with a
kiss.”</p>

<p>Even in the Low Countries the friendly kiss was much in vogue. Adrianus
Höreboord, a professor at the University of Leyden, has, in a Latin
treatise, investigated the question as to whether the custom of allowing
strangers to kiss young girls, widows, and other persons’ wives, on
paying a visit, can be said to be in conformity with the laws of
chastity. Höreboord’s opinion is that such practice is in no way
objectionable: as a kiss can be given without any <i>arrière pensée</i> the
kisses demanded by politeness may be quite chaste.</p>

<p>Erycius Puteanus, the learned Dutch philosopher, on the contrary, holds
that the aforesaid custom is not without danger&mdash;at any rate to more
sensually-disposed temperaments. In a letter on the education of a young
Italian girl he writes that he would never suffer any one to kiss his
pupil, adding: “Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>{157}</span> Flemish girls never do so; they are not so ardent.
They do not comprehend the language of love in glances and kisses. In
the matter of Italian girls on the other hand, things are quite
different, and I teach my pupil the speech of our country and our
customs, kissing excepted.”</p>

<p>The kiss of friendship was so general in Germany, even in the eighteenth
century, that Klopstock could write to a friend in 1750: <i>Vergessen sie
nicht zu mir auf einen Kaffee und auf einen Kuss zu kommen</i>. It seems,
however, soon to have fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>As far back as 1747, Lessing had ridiculed it in a poem:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The kiss with which my friend will greet me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is not what’s rightly termed a kiss,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
VARIOUS KINDS OF KISSES</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been previously shown by numerous examples that kissing occupies
a prominent place in certain ceremonies. It would be easy to multiply
instances of this.</p>

<p>We know from Roman law that the so-called <i>osculum interveniens</i>, which
concerned gifts, was exchanged between engaged couples. The law enacts
that, in the event of one of the contracting parties dying before the
marriage, only a moiety of the presents are to be returned, provided a
kiss was exchanged at the betrothal, but, if no kiss had been exchanged,
all the presents were to be returned.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>{162}</span></p>

<p>The kiss was regarded as the introduction, as it were, to matrimonial
cohabitation&mdash;<i>initium consummationis nuptiarum</i>; it was symbolical of
marriage&mdash;<i>viri et mulieris conjunctio</i>. Certain ancient jurists have
even discussed the question whether a married woman who has suffered
herself to be kissed by a stranger has not thereby rendered herself
guilty of adultery.</p>

<p>The decree of the Roman law which, so far as I know, still partly holds
good in Greece, is met with again in the Latin countries during the
Middle Ages. It was incorporated in the law of the Visigoths (<i>Lex
Romana Visigothorum</i>), and migrated thence to the different old Spanish
<i>fueros</i> and the old French law, in which the word <i>osculum</i> was also
used in the learned form <i>oscle</i>. It was likewise admitted into the law
of the Lombards, and Italy is most probably the West European country
where <i>donatio propter osculum</i> has been longest retained. We find, even
down to our own times, traces of the same in customary laws.</p>

<p>This is probably the only ceremonial kiss that has received legal
sanction; but wherever elsewhere we may turn our eyes and investigate
old ceremonies, we constantly find the kiss a necessary and important
part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>{163}</span></p>

<p>Its usage was, for instance, general at weddings. Thomas Platter, who
studied at the University of Montpellier at the end of the sixteenth
century, tells us, in his “Diary,” that the majority of marriages took
place in private, without witnesses, through fear of witchcraft; though
the wedding feast, on the contrary, was celebrated in public with a vast
concourse of guests, and with many merry episodes. At the conclusion of
the feast the bride was divested of her bridal array, amidst jokes and
raillery, smart young bachelors having to take off her garters; and when
at last she sat up in bed, clad only in linen, then all the guests, male
and female, came and kissed her on the mouth, and the kisses were
followed by facetious compliments and good wishes.</p>

<p>Moreover, at the later ceremony of dubbing a knight, the newly-made
knight of the Golden Fleece was kissed by the master of the ceremonies,
and had afterwards to kiss all the senior knights present.</p>

<p>At certain academical functions the kiss also formed part of the festal
ceremony; in the seventeenth century the Dean, when degrees were
conferred, kissed all the new doctors and masters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>{164}</span></p>

<p>Even in the guilds we meet with the kiss, though in a somewhat peculiar
form. Hübertz tells us that at the ceremony of admitting a member into
the Guild of Tanners, the candidate chose for his “Kränzjungfer” a girl
who had to be “fairly a maiden.” She painted black moustaches on his
upper lip, and the senior member placed a crown on his head. This done,
he kissed the latter, removed the crown, and decorated him instead with
a “Jungferkranz.” Finally, the senior member made a speech to the new
member, and gave him three boxes on the ears, on which the girl kissed
him, and washed off his moustaches, whilst “Vater” hung a sword to his
waist.</p>

<p>The ceremony of reception into the Guild of Carpenters was followed by a
feast, at which the members, as a sign that they were now grown-up, were
allowed, on the payment of a mark, to kiss the barmaid, who was usually
the innkeeper’s daughter.</p>

<p>It is easily understood that the kiss likewise came to play a prominent
part in many different dances and games.</p>

<p>Kiss-dances were very common during the Middle Ages and even later.
Montaigne describes one that he witnessed at Augsburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>{165}</span> in 1580. “The
ladies,” said he, “sit in two rows along the walls of the room. The
gentlemen go away and bow to them; they kiss the latter’s hands, and the
ladies get up, but without kissing them on the hand. Then each gentleman
puts his arm round the lady’s waist, right beneath her shoulder, kisses
her, and lays his cheek to hers.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Whether it is the lady’s check or
mouth that is kissed, he omits to state; but it is certain that kisses
on the mouth were not uncommon.</p>

<p>A Swiss traveller who stayed for some time in France in the middle of
the sixteenth century relates that, when he was in Montpellier, he was
invited to a ball, and there met a very beautiful young lady; but, he
adds, her nose was a trifle too long, and so her partner had great
difficulty in kissing her mouth, “as is the general custom.”</p>

<p>The kiss-dance has not yet died out in Germany; but it appears no longer
to have the graceful forms of the Renaissance period, if we can trust
Fritz Reuter’s description in his <i>Journey to Belgium</i>. At a wedding
when the kiss-dance is to be held, the parish clerk cautiously inquires
of the clergyman whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>{166}</span> kissing is regarded as unbefitting his
priestly dignity, but when the answer comes short and shrewd, “Kiss
away,” he bows to Mrs Black and&mdash;smack!&mdash;gives her a couple of hearty
kisses right on her mouth. Madame was thoroughly frightened, but that
did not avail, but every time he swang round with her, she got a proper,
smacking kiss.</p>

<p>But it is evident from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> that even in England there
were dances in which a gentleman was allowed to kiss his partner. All
know the beautiful words with which Romeo claims his right:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I profane with my unworthiest hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. (I. 5.)<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>One can still take the same liberty at Christmastide under the
mistletoe. I know a young English lady who was offended with an American
gentleman who did not dare to avail himself of his privilege, because he
thought that this custom was obsolete in Europe.</p>

<p>Kissing in our time still plays an important part in France in the
refrains of dance songs. <i>Le Bouquet de ma Mie</i> ends with:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bell’ bergère, embrasse-moi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embrasse, embrasse, embrasse!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>{167}</span></p>

<p class="nind">And in <i>Ramenez vos Moutons, Bergère</i>, is sung by way of conclusion:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tombez à genoux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jurez devant tous.<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is, I suppose, no doubt that in these games the kiss is given and
taken, as the <i>dramatis personæ</i> are generally children, but what takes
place when adults amuse themselves with these <i>rondes</i>, I do not know;
but I consider it probable that the gentleman will demand as his due a
kiss, at any rate on the cheek. There also exists an old <i>ronde à
baisers</i>, which is very characteristic and merry. In this it is the lady
who has to take the first step:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Madame, entrez dans la danse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regardez-en la cadence,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>{168}</span></p>

<p>As the living expression of the warmest and sincerest human feelings
kissing has been credited, in the world of fairy tales and superstition,
with a considerable curative and prophylactical power.</p>

<p>We have seen, in the old sagas and ballads, how enchantments are broken
by means of a kiss; we have seen how holy men in the legends restore the
sick to health by means of a kiss, etc. Kissing has, on the whole,
influenced popular credulity to a large extent, and of the numerous
superstitious notions concerning it I only quote some few:</p>

<p>If you would protect yourself against lightning you should make three
crosses before you, and kiss the ground three times. (Germany.)</p>

<p>If you want to have luck in gambling you must kiss the cards before the
game begins. (France.)</p>

<p>If you have the toothache you should kiss a donkey on his chops.
(Germany.) This very efficacious advice is found as far back as Pliny.</p>

<p>If you drop a bit of bread on the floor you must kiss it when you pick
it up. The same respect is also to be shown to books you have dropped.
(Denmark, Germany.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>{169}</span></p>

<p>According to Danish superstition, it is a bad omen when the first person
you meet of a morning is an old woman; nevertheless, you can ward off
all evil consequences by giving her a kiss. Evil must be expelled by
evil.</p>

<p>People kiss little children when they have knocked themselves, in order
to take away the pain; they must “kiss them well again,” as it is
termed, or, as Englishmen say, “kiss the place and make it well.”</p>

<p>The Greenland mother, who does not understand kissing as expressive of
love, kisses her sick child on the breast, shoulders, hips, and navel to
restore it to health.</p>

<p>As the loving kiss of a living human creature brings life, health, and
happiness, so it is thought, on the other hand, that kisses of a
supernatural being bring destruction.</p>

<p>In Lucian’s <i>True History</i> there is a description of a perilous journey
to the realms of fancy. In one of these the travellers came upon a
remarkable vineyard wherein all the vines at the bottom were green and
luxuriant, but those above had the shape of women. “They greeted us, as
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>{170}</span> drew nigh, and bade us halt. Some of us kissed them on the mouth,
and those who were kissed lost their understanding and reeled about like
drunken men. But worse befell those who had suffered themselves to be
embraced by these women; they were powerless to extricate themselves
from the latter’s arms, and we beheld their fingers changed into boughs
and twigs.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>I will here call your attention to the Roumanian song about cholera,
which comes in the shape of an ugly old woman to Vîlcu, and Vîlcu
entreats it thus: “Take my horse, take my weapons, but give me still
some days so I may once more see my children, which are as dear to me as
the light of the sun.” But the old woman stretches forth her bony arms,
folds Vîlcu to her bosom, presses her pallid lips to his, and, in a
death-dealing kiss, takes his life, whereupon she departs with a mocking
laugh. The Roumanian text is here very strong:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gură pe gură punea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buze pe buze lipĭa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zilele i le sorbĭa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>{171}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apoĭ cloanza ear ridea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cu zilele purcedea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si voĭnicul mort cădea.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even a spectre’s kiss brings death. In an English variant of the ballad
of Leonora, Margaret says to her dead bridegroom, who is knocking at her
door at night: “Come and kiss me on the cheek and chin.”&mdash;“Perhaps I
shall come to thee,” he replies, but:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I shou’d come within thy bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am no mortal man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shou’d I kiss thy rosy lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy days will not be long.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I shall also call your attention, in connection with the foregoing, to a
curious old story of the venomous girl.</p>

<p>A young maiden had from her tenderest years been reared on all the most
deadly poisons. Her beauty was marvellous, but her breath was so
poisonous that it killed everybody who came near her. She was sent to
the palace of Alexander the Great, as the king’s enemies reckoned on his
falling in love with her and dying in her arms. When the king saw her he
at once wanted to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>{172}</span> her his mistress; but the shrewd Aristotle
suspected treachery. He restrained the king, and had a criminal who had
been sentenced to death sent for. The criminal was made to kiss the girl
in presence of the king, and he fell prone on the ground, poisoned by
her breath, like one struck by lightning.</p>

<p>This story can be traced to India. It found its way into several
mediæval storybooks and attained great popularity. The monks made use of
it in their sermons, and gave it an allegorical interpretation:
Alexander was the good, trustful Christian; Aristotle was the
conscience; the venomous girl, incontinence, which comprehends
everything that is poisonous to the soul; and the criminal is the wicked
man who pursues the lusts of the flesh and suffers his punishment. “Let
us, therefore, abstain from all such things if we wish to reach
Paradise,” is the moral that the monk draws from it at the close of his
sermon.</p>

<p>In conclusion I will quote several expressions to which kissing has
given rise:</p>

<p>A lady’s hat which was fashionable in England in 1850, and which had no
brim to it, got the name of <i>Kiss-me-quick</i>. In contradistinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>{173}</span> to
this, the old-fashioned Danish hats with prominent brims were called
<i>Kiss-me-if-you-can</i>. We have a modern variant in the Salvation lasses’
<i>Stop-kissing-me</i> hat.</p>

<p>In France, during the last century, there was a colour of the name of
<i>Baise-moi ma mignonne</i>, called in England “heart’s-ease”:
<i>Look-up-and-kiss-me</i>, <i>Kiss-me-at-the-garden-gate</i>,
<i>Kiss-me-ere-I-rise</i> or <i>Jump-up-and-kiss-me</i>.</p>

<p>The verb “to kiss” is often used in a figurative sense, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Italians say of one who likes drinking, “He kisses the flask” (<i>Bacia il
fiasco</i>); the Germans say of mean people, “They kiss the farthing” (<i>Den
Pfennig küssen</i>); the English too speak of a <i>penny-kisser</i>.</p>

<p>This figurative meaning is not, however, confined to jocose expressions
and phrases; on the contrary, it occurs perhaps more frequently in
serious prose.</p>

<p>Our whole life, lived in love to our neighbour and nature, is nothing
more than one long kiss.</p>

<p>Kaalund somewhere says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A babe was I not long ere this,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But time too swiftly slips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that is why I press a kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So warmly on life’s lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">W. F. H.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>{174}</span></p>

<p>A similar figurative use is extraordinarily common with the poets. H. C.
Andersen, in <i>Goose-grass</i>, says of the lark that it flies past the
tulip and other aristocratic flowers only to light on the sward by the
humble goose-grass, which it kisses with its beak, and for which it
sings its joyous song. The other poets represent the waves as kissing
the white beach, the bees, the scented flowers; and the ears of corn in
the fields as heaving beneath the warm kisses of the sun’s golden rays.
The sun’s kisses are <i>oscula sancta</i>; every creature shares in them, for
they are the most beautiful expression of God’s love. Ingemann sings in
a morning hymn:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
THE ORIGIN OF KISSING</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">With</span> most civilised and many uncivilised nations kissing is the natural
expression of love and its kindred emotions.</p>

<p>How can it be explained that a kiss has succeeded in getting so deep and
comprehensive a significance? How can a trivial movement of the lips
interpret our innermost feelings in so eloquent a way that there is not
a language which has at its command words approaching to it in
argumentative power?</p>

<p>Are we face to face with something primitive, or something conventional
and derivative? Is it as natural to kiss when we are transported with
love as it is to smile when we are mirthful, or weep when we are sad? In
other words, is Steele right when he says, in strict conformity with a
Cypriot folk-song previously quoted, that “nature was its author, and it
began with the first courtship?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>{178}</span></p>

<p>I shall try to answer this question in the following pages, but,
nevertheless, I wish at once to state most expressly that we are now
approaching ground where we know nothing, and where no one can with
certainty know anything. We can only advance more or less likely
hypotheses.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is important to bear in mind that there are many
races of people who are quite ignorant of kissing as it is generally
understood. Thus it is unknown in a great part of Polynesia, in
Madagascar, and among many tribes of negroes in Africa, more
particularly among those which mutilate their lips. W. Reade, in one of
his books of travel, tells us of the horror which seized a young African
negress when he kissed her. Kissing is likewise unknown amongst the
Esquimaux and the people of Tierra del Fuego. Certain Finnish tribes
appear, from what B. Taylor tells us, not to practise it much. In his
<i>Northern Travel</i> he relates that “while both sexes bathe together in a
state of complete nudity, a kiss is regarded as something indecent.” A
Finnish married woman, on being told by him that it was the usual custom
for husband and wife to kiss each other, angrily exclaimed, “If my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>{179}</span>
husband were to attempt such a thing, faith, I would warm his ears in
such a way that he would feel it for a whole week.”</p>

<p>If the question arises as to what these people substitute for kissing,
the fact is well-known that, amongst uncivilised races, there is an
endless number of different ways of salutation; some smack each other on
the arms or stomach, others blow on each other’s hands, others again rub
their right ear and put out their tongue, etc., etc. Here, however, we
must confine ourselves to the salutations which are suggestive of
kissing.</p>

<p>In many places people are in the habit of saluting with their noses.
This is the so-called Malay kiss, which consists in rubbing or merely
pressing one’s nose against another person’s nose. This nose-salute is
found among the Polynesians, Malays, Esquimaux, certain negro tribes in
Africa&mdash;in short, just among the majority of races which are ignorant of
kissing as we understand it.</p>

<p>Darwin thus describes the Malay kiss: “The women squatted with their
faces upturned; my attendants stood leaning over them, laid the bridge
of their noses at right angles over theirs, and commenced rubbing. It
lasted somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>{180}</span> longer than a hearty hand-shake with us. During this
process they uttered a grunt of satisfaction.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The French <i>savant</i>
Gaidoz, who has also described this custom, remarks, “I have many times
observed that cats which are fond of one another greet each other in
this way; and I myself once had a cat which always tried to squeeze its
nose against mine as a mark of affection.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Everything is in favour of this nose-salute being a very primitive
custom, and its origin may be sought beyond the sense of touch; no
doubt, in the sense of smell.</p>

<p>Spencer has arrived at the following conclusions: The sheep bleats after
her little lamb which has run away. It sniffs at several lambs that are
skipping about near her, and at last recognises her own by means of the
sense of smell, and undoubtedly feels great delight at recognising it.
In consequence of assiduous repetitions of this a certain relation is
developed between the two factors, so that the smell of the lamb excites
joy in the sheep.</p>

<p>As every animal has its peculiar smell, so, too, has every human being.
When the patriarch Isaac grew old his eyes began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>{181}</span> get dim, and he
could not see. He wished to bless his eldest son, Esau, but Jacob
deceived him by clothing himself in his brother’s garments, and giving
himself out as the latter. Isaac then said to him: “Come near now and
kiss me, my son.” And he came near and kissed him, and he smelled the
smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said: “See the smell of my
son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed.”</p>

<p>The sense of the smell peculiar to some one we are fond of is capable of
exciting pleasure. Timkowski writes of a Mongol father that the latter
time after time smelt his youngest son’s head. This mark of paternal
tenderness serves with the Mongols instead of kisses. In the Philippine
Islands, the sense of smell is so developed that the inhabitants, by
simply sniffing at a pocket-handkerchief, can tell to whom it belongs;
lovers who are separated send one another presents of bits of their
linen, and, in their absence, keep each other in mind by often inhaling
each other’s scent.</p>

<p>That the delicate perfume that exhales from a woman’s body plays an
important part in love affairs even with modern civilised nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>{182}</span> is
too well-known to require more than a passing mention on my part.</p>

<p>Certain races of mankind now actually salute each other by smelling;
they apply their mouth and nose to a person’s cheek, and draw a long
breath. In their language they do not say “Give me a kiss,” but “Smell
me.” The same sort of kiss is also met with among the Burmese; and with
many Malay tribes the words “smell” and “salute” are synonymous. Other
races do not confine themselves to smelling each other’s faces, but
sniff their hands at every salutation.</p>

<p>Alfred Grandidier, a French traveller, says of the nose-kiss in
Madagascar: “It always excites the merriment of Europeans, and yet it
has its origin in an extremely refined idea. The invisible air which is
continually being breathed through the lips is to savages, not only, as
with us, a sign of life, but it is also an emanation of the soul&mdash;its
perfume, as they themselves say&mdash;and, when they mingle and suck in each
other’s breath and odour, they think they are actually mingling their
souls.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Then the origin of the nose-kiss, it seems, undoubtedly ought to be
sought&mdash;at any rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>{183}</span> partly&mdash;in the sense of smell. The love of another
human being involves, as a consequence, one’s loving everything
belonging to this other being; and this love is shown <i>in casu</i> by
drinking in his or her breath, whereby, little by little, a peculiar
nose-salutation is very ingeniously developed, which, naturally, is
capable of gradually assuming various conventional forms.</p>

<p>Now we will proceed to the kiss proper&mdash;that on the mouth. How can its
origin be explained?<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It does not seem very rational to assume that the motion of the muscles
in breathing should of itself be the natural, purely physical reflex of
a feeling of love in the same way as, for instance, certain
half-spasmodic contractions of several muscles in the upper part of the
face can be the immediate expression of wrath.</p>

<p>I do not believe either that the mere contact of the lips with another
person’s face was originally sufficient to express “I love you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>{184}</span>
Naturally, the longing to touch the beloved ones body, to approach it as
closely as possible, is a very essential manifestation of erotic
emotion; but so far as the contact of the lips is concerned, there is
reason for assuming that, originally, without its being the direct
object, it had been, moreover, and perhaps in an equally high degree, a
means of attaining a definite sensual gratification&mdash;a gratification
that can be realised by the co-operation of the lips and mouth.</p>

<p>As the nose-salutation partly originates in smell, so the mouth
salutation may, to a certain extent<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> at least, have its origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>{185}</span> in
taste, or&mdash;which is even more probable&mdash;in both smell and taste? These
latter, as you know, are very closely related to each other.</p>

<p>The dog shows his joy at his master’s presence by licking the latter’s
hand. Why is this? It would not, I suppose, be too rash to assume that
he as good as “tastes” him; loving his master, he therefore loves the
taste and smell peculiar to him.</p>

<p>The cow licks her calf, and in this one may presumably see the
expression of a feeling which is to some extent satisfied by this
action. And why so? Undoubtedly by recognising by the tongue (and nose)
the taste (and smell) peculiar to the calf.</p>

<p>Now, is it not exceedingly probable that the human kiss, in its original
form, can, as to its passive element, be accounted for in an identical
way, viz., as a purely sensual assimilation, by means of the nerves of
taste and smell, of another person’s peculiar qualities with respect to
<i>gustus</i> and <i>odor</i>? These qualities have probably been much more
conspicuous in primitive mankind than nowadays, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>{186}</span> it is quite
certain that its faculty of taste and smell were far more developed than
ours.</p>

<p>And have we not still, especially in the love-kiss, but also in kisses
between women, very numerous representatives of the primitive kiss,
which I should like to term the “taste-kiss.” I have many times pointed
out, in the preceding pages, the part which taste plays in kissing; and
I shall now add what I have often heard young girls say to a lady they
had kissed amorously: “Your kisses taste so nice.”</p>

<p>From being a natural expression for love the sucking, tasting kiss has,
in course of time, become reduced to nothing more than a simple
inspiratory movement of the lips, which, by analogy, has come to express
many other feelings, such as gratitude, admiration, compassion,
tenderness, etc. It has become at length so degraded as to be used as a
purely conventional salutation.</p>

<p>If this reasoning be correct, then the mouth-kiss, in the course of its
development, presents a perfect parallel with the nose-kiss. Both these
forms of greeting were originally closely allied, but the mouth-kiss had
better conditions for development than the nose-kiss. It has become a
salutation of a considerably higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>{187}</span> sort, and whenever savage tribes
come into contact with civilised nations the nose-kiss is gradually
discarded. Such, for instance, was the case in Madagascar. There is no
doubt that savages can express very deep emotions by the nose-kiss. A
French missionary tells the story of how he was received when he went
back to the island of Pomotu: “When we approached the country all the
population assembled on the beach. They had harpoons in their hands, for
they imagined we were enemies; but, as soon as they saw my cassock, they
shouted, ‘That’s the Father, away with the harpoons,’ and when we
reached the shore they all rushed forward to kiss me by rubbing their
noses against mine, according to the custom of that country. The
ceremony was not very agreeable to me, and I was not altogether pleased
at having to take part in it.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Civilised people, on the other hand,
regard the nose-kiss as something highly ludicrous, and I doubt if any
poet has the power of casting a halo of romance over it.</p>

<p>The mouth-kiss, on the contrary, is redolent of the purest and most
delicate poesy. A German minnesinger rhapsodises<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>{188}</span> thus: “The radiant sun
is darkened before mine eyes when I behold the roses that bloom on my
darling’s mouth.”</p>

<p>“He who can pluck these roses may rejoice in the depth of his heart.
Many are the roses I have beheld, but never have I looked on any so
splendid.”</p>

<p>“How beauteous are the roses one gathers in the valley; nathless her
delicate, ruddy lips conjure up thousands that are lovelier still.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>{189}</span></p>

explanations given by the poets as to the origin of the kiss. Gressner,
in an idyll of Daphnis and Chloe, has told us how both the lovers
observed the sport of the doves in the grove and then tried to imitate
it by pressing their mouths together as the doves do their beaks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Besides the passive or receptive element of the kiss,
which is essentially the object of my investigation, there is also, as
we have previously noticed, an active element which must not be
overlooked, viz., the contact and muscular sensation at the pressure.
During the erotic transport, which excites the desire for something
further of a brutal and violent nature, the body trembles with powerful
muscular tension, and a pressure or bite of the mouth is one of the
forms by which the passion of love finds expression. It is difficult, in
these pages, to go further into this aspect of the kiss, which is
regarded by certain philosophers as the main one, which it really is in
respect to certain kisses under certain circumstances; but there are
other kisses which are equally so originally, and in which the passive
element seems to me the most essential. The origin of the love-kiss
ought scarcely to be sought in any single source, whether in the sense
of touch or in that of taste and smell combined. Unquestionably both
these elements co-operate in its production, but under constantly
varying conditions, just as the active or the passive element
predominates, the kiss accompanies and interprets according to the
erotic phase. In what follows I shall confine myself exclusively to the
receptive element in the kiss.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
